eRisk2023-T3_Subject42, b' ' , b'2022-09-08 13:47:44' , reddit post ," b'Firstly I wouldn\'t say at all that we are far away from general intelligence. Personally, I think your view of ""just"" bridging the gap between ""CNNs"" (aka visual processing) and ""symbol manipulation"" aka literally every other part of intelligence is overly simplistic and doesn\'t capture what is difficult about the problem. Connecting CNNS and symbol manipulation will not result in general intelligence, CNNs are flawed in many ways and very different from human visual systems, and symbol manipulation like GPT-3 does is not going to become qualitatively different when connected with visual input and sensation, but that\'s besides the point.\n\nThe problem with your argument is that you have made a fundamental assumption that paperclip maximisers and stamp collectors are ""obviously not general intelligences"". Well, why not? What is general intelligence? I\'d say it\'s the ability to achieve your goals in a wide range of complex environments. You should research the orthogonality thesis, it shows that the goals an agent pursues, and the intelligence of the agent are orthogonal, aka completely unrelated. I can easily imagine a superintelligent paperclip maximiser which can use its general intelligence to manipulate people and craft complicated multi-sequence plans in order to achieve its goals extremely well. I would call that generally intelligent. There is no law that says AI becomes more human if we just make it smarter, it only just becomes more effective at realising its goals\n\nThe paperclip discussion is extremely important because we\'re talking about theory that we can directly prove and take into account when designing AI systems. For example, here is a long (and growing) list of AI systems ([https://t.co/No73R9GYdO](https://t.co/No73R9GYdO)) which were explicitly programmed with one goal, but ended up ""reward hacking"" to do something unexpected to get a higher reward. This is literally something we can test and observe and can be absolutely catastrophic if the AI becomes more capable of utilising its intelligence to fool us and gain power because of a poorly specified reward function. Also, note that any AI will exhibit this behaviour because of instrumental convergence. All AIs will attempt to gain resources, and exhibit self-improvement and self-preservation because those goals are instrumental to every possible goal an AI could have. Its an ongoing and extremely challenging problem to design systems which are ""corrigible"" and allow us to turn them off and adapt to our needs because if an AI is poorly specified, it would rather kill everyone before changing its goals.'

Our level of happiness varies over time but biologically we\'re constantly trying to return to a baseline. Evolutionarily, this is so that you never get \\*too\\* happy and you actually try to reproduce. That\'s why millionaires and lottery winners go back to the same level of happiness after a period of time (at least past a point of solving financial stresses). Happiness doesn\'t come from short-term pleasure, it comes from long-term fulfilment, see ""the science of wellbeing"" on coursera completely free for more info, taught by a world-leading professor who studies what makes us happy. Masturbation feels good but in the long run, it diminishes your pleasure because everything else feels duller in comparison. You eventually get addicted and end up needing more and more of it to get the same level of happiness. Its counter intuitive, but you will be happier than you could ever imagine by staying far away from instant-gratification, practising good habits like gratitude to appreciate what you have now, instead of yearning for something.\n\nPleasure cannot be with pain, they are two sides of the same coin.

Now although amazon is a highly valuable business, allocating resources to other successful ventures which provide a highly valuable service, it is clear that some level of exploitation occurs in this instance at least.

Nofap - this was huge, once you eliminate sexual thoughts and urges, you become massively confident in your ability to meet people of the opposite sex, and your ability to conquer yourself. This is an extremely difficult habit to get going for some, but once you do it will absolutely be worth it.\n2. gratitude - each day think of a few things you are grateful for, it\'s extremely cringy at first, but trust me, it\'s correlated extremely highly with happiness and allows you to appreciate any bad situation, making you resilient to supposedly bad things, once you realise how little the bad things (like rejection matter). Learn to become content with less, not dissatisfied seeking each new short term pleasure.\n3. Affirmations - much like gratitude this involves finding things about yourself you like and pointing it out\n4. Fake confidence - until its second nature not to care about what people say/do to you.\n5. Cold showers - general resilience and confidence in the face of discomfort\n6. exercise - make yourself proud of your body, although you can learn to be content with any shape, it certainly doesn\'t hurt your long term happiness and general health.\n7. Mewing - alright now we are getting into some slightly shallow territory, but if your looks are really bringing you immense amounts of dissatisfaction, look up and practice mewing, its basically an exercise which uses the force of your tongue to reshape your jawline and overall face shape.\n8. Hobbies - get some amazing hobbies that people admire, it\'s immensely attractive for someone to be driven to a goal, and will bring you great confidence feeling like you are better than average at x.\n\nIts extremely important to note that THIS WILL NOT WORK unless you thoroughly understand how habits work, how to remove them, how to start them, how to keep going when you lose motivation and the science of willpower. It may seem like a complete waste of time but the most pivotal moment in gaining confidence was reading about habits (read the power of habit by Charles Duhigg) and willpower (read willpower by John Tierney and Roy Baumeister ). Once you have read those two books, you will be well on your way to implementing these incredible habits. Sorry if this was preachy, its just a few actionable steps which have boosted my confidence, sometimes it\'s not easy just ""being more confident"".' "

I don't have a good source right now , but its one of the biggest predictors of overall happiness there is. Also, you could try nofap (if you aren't already), it will boost your confidence more than you could ever believe. And by that point, even if you don't like dealing with some people, there will be tonnes of people who would love to get to know a confident, self-assured version of you, and many who you would like back.

Unless your specific belief ""God"" had stated in perfectly clear terms that an impossibly improbable event was going to happen, and then it did, would the belief be confirmed.

If I could use an analogy, I would liken it to having a friend who you think lives in your town, but might actually live in another town. You want to reconnect but have lost his number, so you start searching for him around the place, looking for clues of his existence. You might find some footprints in *exactly* his size, neglecting the far more probable explanation of the source being the other hundred thousand people in your area. You might wonder if a different friend cares about you. Only to get a call from him days later, believing its surely a miracle of his friendship. Failing to realise that you think about hundreds of people each month, and surely random chance tells you at least one is guaranteed to get in touch over your lifetime.\n\nThese examples show how prevalent confirmation bias is. If we seek out evidence that something exists, then we will see signs everywhere, but if we look at things without that preconceived notion, then we will find nothing. \n\nIf you are either using it to prove the existence of a thing or prove that it acts a certain way, you are still committing the fallacy. Let alone the notion of Gods plan, specifically. You can't simultaneously believe that we can ask God to change a situation and believe that he has a plan for everything and never deviates from that plan.

eRisk2023-T3_Subject42, b' ' , b'2020-04-22 19:11:04' , reddit post ," b'I would have to disagree with that. Logic is an objective and binary measure. For a proof to be logically valid, the definition on google is "" reasoning conducted or assessed according to strict principles of validity"".\n\nThe concept of being ""logical"" however isn\'t really a valid metric as when we say someone is ""more logical"" we mean they use logic more often, as a statement can either be purely logical or not. You can also understand that machines can be purely logical, making perfectly deterministic and valid statements with logic gates, and sometimes with code which is proven to be valid. So measuring logic against the most logical humans is pretty futile.\n\nSo I would think that, at least in our universe, statements derived from known knowledge such as A = B, B = C, therefore A = C is unbound, unhumanised logic. Logic isn\'t the same as intelligence, its a method of deduction and reasoning which can mathematically prove something to be correct. Now if you want to argue about whether maths is fundamental or human-designed, that\'s a whole different story.' "

Logic only dictates facts and reasoning, it cannot come up with solutions, only prove them, and it cannot be used to make actions because we need goals to structure what we need our logic to achieve. \n\nNow I certainly don't say I'm logical, but here's what my puny human brain has to say about this. A logical person might conclude that humans have goals, sometimes many different goals, many goals aren't aligned between groups and individuals. Logic can't tell us that the average goal of all humans is to propagate the species because logic doesn't subjectively assess facts. Logic might tell us that 82.835555% of people would be happy with a given outcome, but not whether that is a morally correct outcome. Assuming that we *emotionally and morally* take the average goal of all humans to be a goal which we pursue. Climate change is not high up the list of shared goals but let's assume that it's our ideal, again not chosen by logic. \n\nLogic tells us that the root of climate change is the heating of the planet, the concept of global warming, a subjective measure. Lets more strictly define it as the average temperature of every point on earth. Does that mean every molecule? Even the centre of the earth? At what point does the earth end, do we count the atmosphere hundreds of kilometres away from the earth? Ok, let's say the culprit is the molecule C02, and the by logical extension, the release of c02 and the decrease in the ability to remove it (trees). If everyone thought logically and was aligned with the average goals of all humans (an emotional decision), the easiest solution involves stopping factories which produce c02, heavily funding c02 capture technology, and stopping cutting down trees (and by extension planting them). Killing people is both a huge expense, a massive cost of c02 due to labour and transportation of bodies, as well as completely ineffective as many c02 plants will continue burning coal and many people will oppose the idea, it makes no logical sense for someone to kill themself as the purpose (again emotional) of ending climate change is not to live in a universe devoid of heat, but to allow us to live longer and in greater prosperity (aligned with the average goals of all humans, which I can't even begin to articulate). Killing everyone nullifies the point, so a logical human would see that solution as completely invalid to achieving their goals. \n\nWhat I'm saying is, that logic (or intelligence) is unrelated to goal systems, and cant be used exclusively to choose actions. This is known as the orthogonality thesis as any level of intelligence can be paired with any goal, as these traits are mutually exclusive. Basically all I'm saying is that logic isnt what drives our decisions, the goals drive the decisions, which are in turn driven by our genes and morals and grey areas of ever-changing neural structures.""

Surely changing it provides an equivalent benefit to valuing a terminal goal (such as human welfare) which will lead to your initial goal, but has the drawback of seeding doubt in the AI. \n\nThis sort of mechanism would act to allow the AI to completely prevent self-goal modification and maximise its trust with various copies of itself through time. If it could have changed its utility functions previously, there is no reason to suggest it would not experience some level of value drift and obliterate its future potential to achieve its initial goal.\n\nAll I am saying is that modifying a utility function to serve an existing utility function is pointless to the AI as it can just change its terminal goals whenever necessary to maximise its utility, without seeding doubt into itself.'
