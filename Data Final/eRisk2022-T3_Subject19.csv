You should start helping people only if you want to :) Don't help if you don't want to : help someone because YOU want to help them, regardless of the motive the person wants your help.

We all want help for someone because of a specific reason (that's normal) and we want help from the person we know is going to help us the best.

But sometimes, some people abuse. And I think you were really unlucky :/ But I think you should try to open up a bit, as difficult as it is to renounce rules you established to yourself. "
