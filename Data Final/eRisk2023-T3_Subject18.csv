At first we were friends but then we had a short relationship which lasted around a month. After that we became friends again and we didn't really have anything romantic going on and we would have sex very very very sporadically. There were no romantic feelings though.\n\nAs mentally ill people, we both appreciate it having someone that understands what it's like to suffer from this sort of conditions. He has expressed how much he appreciates me and my friendship multiple times.\n\nHowever in the past month he has told me that he now has a girlfriend. I completely understood and of course wasn't going to engage in sexual activities with him anymore. He told me that he wanted to still be friends and that it would be okay and that he appreciates me.\n\nAnyway time went on and it seems that this girlfriend is not comfortable with us being friends and she has made it clear to Fernando that she's not happy that he has me as a friend given the fact that I'm his ex. He told me that and I sort of insisted that he should be able to make his own choices and that she should understand and trust him. He thought about it and said that what I was saying was reasonable and then then we could continue to be friends.\n\nHowever today he has texted me that he needs to distance himself from me because her girlfriend doesn't want us to be friends anymore and that it is his priority to keep his girlfriend.\n\nOf course, I think I deeply believe that this is wrong and that a good person who loves you will not try to limit who your friends are no matter what especially since you're promising that nothing's going to happen. But am I wrong to think this way? \n\nMy instincts in this instance would be to try to convince him that she's wrong and that he's giving in and losing a friend... but at the same time I am tired I'm tired of fighting for our friendship and he's seemingly not willing to fight for me... should I just ignore him and block him everywhere?\n\nWhat do you think? I am very lost at this point.\n\n\nTLDR: my friend with whom I had a short relationship has a new girlfriend and she doesn't want him to have any contact with me because of our history. Should I insist that we remain friends or should I just let him go and tell him to f*** off because he's not willing to fight for our friendship like I have so far?"" "

I told my friends and my mum, and then I went to therapy but nothing helped. After that I went to a psychiatrist who gave me some pills but i couldn't notice any effects. Living in my brain was so painful. There was absolutely nothing I could enjoy. I had tried everything in my power to get better, so eventually I thought my only way out was suicide. God I was close to doing it. Thankfully my mum suggested to call an ambulance and I was hospitalised for two weeks. I got better and now i'm doing well!"" "

I personally was convinced that all the doctors were actors. It is impossible to reason with someone who's at that stage. Nothing will help. So yeah my advice is to prevent that person from reaching that stage, however that may be. Taking meds is important. Mine were Olanzapine and they did help with the delusions but they had quite a lot of side effects, one of them being they leave you quite drowsy and sleepy. My advice is, when they are still being reasonable, try to make them see that hospitalisation might help them. As for help when they are inside, board games are fun. But just be careful they don't contain any piece of glass. They don't let us have anything with glass that could potentially be used for self harm. Also if the person is artsy, some art supplies would be nice. In my ward we'd paint mandalas and things like that. We'd also make bracelets. \n\nIt's alright, I'm a lot better now.

Vaig neixer a Barcelona l\'octubre de l\'any 1995, la qual cosa em fa del signe del zodiac libra, pero aquestes coses son bestieses. Vaig neixer en una familia de classe mitjana bastant preocupada per la meva educacio. Vaig anar a escoles concertades i privades, fins que vaig acabar a la universitat, on vaig estudiar traduccio i interpretacio. Vaig fer dues practiques unes a Catalunya, a la Sindicatura de Comptes de la Generalitat, i les altres a Austria, a l\'Organisme Internacional d\'Energia Atomica. Despres d\'aquestes experiencies podem dir que gairebe laborals vaig patir una greu depressio a causa de la qual vaig haver de ser ingressada a l\'Hospital de Sant Pau i de la Santa Creu de Barcelona, que em va salvar la vida. Sempre els ho agraire. Despres d\'aquest entrebanc vaig decidir-me a estudiar un Master en Dret internacional, la qual cosa es una bogeria, tenint en compte que m\'estava recuperant i que no es la meva materia. Pero podem dir que me\'n vaig sortir prou be. \n\n Ara que us he donat les meves dades biografiques a grans trets (basicament des del punt de vista professional, vaja) vull explicar-vos una mica mes sobre qui soc. Soc una noia bastant blanca de pell, d\'estatura mitjana i bastant prima per la meva altura. De tota manera tambe es pot dir que soc voluptuosa, no soc pas recta. Tinc la cara mes aviat allargada, el front ample, els ulls grans i de color marro. El nas es mes aviat gros, una micona d\'aliga. El meu pare diu que es un nas roma. Tinc les dents perfectament rectes en un somriure bastant bonic tot gracies a les meravelles de l\'ortodoncia. Pel que fa a la resta del cos, puc destacar que tinc unes mans bastant boniques, una cintura ben petitona, el ventre relativament pla i les cames bastant llargues.\n\n Molt be, molt be, direu. Ens es igual el fisic. L\'important es l\'interior. Bajanades. Tothom diu aixo pero ningu no s\'ho acaba de creure. De tota manera, tambe us penso explicar com soc, com a persona. M\'agrada pensar que soc una persona amb principis, lleial als meus amics, honesta, exigent amb mi mateixa, treballadora, ambiciosa, comprensiva... Segurament dec semblar una creguda pero m\'es bastant igual. M\'agrada fer riure a la gent, fer-los sentir comodes al meu costat, fer-la petar, anar a caminar, cantar, maquillar-me, llegir i escriure, de vegades dibuixar... No tinc molts amics, pero els que tinc valen molt.\n\n\n\n\n\n' "
