I can\'t speak for all autistic people but I can give a different perspective on that. \n\n>Wouldnt social banning of a word just give it more inherent power?\n\nI see why one would assume that but no, it doesn\'t give it more power. For a word to be seen as banned by society there has to be some sort of agreement by a significant portion of society that said word is harmful enough to warrant that. \n\nBanning (or socially suppressing) the usage of a word takes power away from those who use it, because using the word turns them into a target. Think of bullying scenes in movies, where the bully insults someone and everyone laughs at the person. Now imagine instead of everyone laughing most people getting mad at the bully. \n \n>words such as ""retard"" are used mostly as a synonym as slow, dumb, etc - wouldnt it make more sense to just accept societies attempt to move the word away from relations of mental disorders?\n\nNo, because that\'s what it means. It means someone lacks intelligence. When you use it as an insult directed at a person who doesn\'t have a developmental or learning disability because they did something wrong you are implicitly equating doing that to having a disability. Using it as an insult implies that being \'slow\' or \'dumb\' are character flaws and that \'slow\' or \'dumb\'people are inferior.' "

Having a PhD doesn\'t mean the person is knowledgeable about everything.\n\nYou used this argument in reply to the other commenter saying you\'re an example of the Dunning-Kruger effect. Saying someone else has a PhD and agrees with you doesn\'t mean that you are not an example of the Dunning-Kruger effect, even if said person (or group of people) was right. You clearly think that you understand about vaccines and yet you haven\'t linked to any evidence that you have any expertise in vaccines, epidemiology, medicine, or anything related to those areas.\n\nRegarding the content and topic:\n\nI don\'t know who Dr. Peter McCullough is, so I won\'t address that, but I\'ll research it later and maybe post an edit.\n\nThe study you linked to was retracted because of methodological concerns: [https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/15/7754/htm](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/15/7754/htm)\n\nAbout side effects: Up to 90% of vaccinated individuals reported having side effects, but if you remove the ""headache"", ""pain in injection site"", ""dizziness"", ""heaviness on injection arm"", ""rash"" and other similar (as in an annoyance rather than a health risk), it drops to less than 0.5%, with the majority of these less than 0.5% being anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) \n\n[https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/article-abstract/2787361](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/article-abstract/2787361)\n\n[https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/10/8/1419/htm#B7-healthcare-10-01419](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/10/8/1419/htm#B7-healthcare-10-01419)\n\nMany of these anaphylaxis cases were in people who had severe allergies to medications or autoimmune disorders\n\nI\'m definitely not an expert in either medicine or ethics, so this is just an opinion: \n\nIf someone refuses to take a vaccine that helps prevent COVID cases and deaths because of stuff like arm pain or headaches for less than 5 days without any real, statistically significant risk, that person should not be allowed in public places. \n\nIf the person has a medical condition that means taking the vaccine is an actual risk, I wouldn\'t judge them for not taking it, but anything other than that is, in my opinion, morally unacceptable.'

Addiction is often secondary to other mental disorders. Depression, bipolar disorder, personality disorders and ADHD have particularly high chances of leading to addiction. Other than that there\'s also peer pressure (mostly with teens), prescribed drugs turning into addictions, using drugs for a ""functional"" purpose (such as amphetamines to study for tests or to stay awake at work) and that turning into an addiction, etc.\n\nThat being said, imo being an addict definitely doesn\'t give you a moral free pass to stealing or hurting other people in any way. Addiction itself is not the person\'s fault, but stealing is. If you know you are prone to losing control while high, it is your responsibility to keep yourself from affecting other people who have nothing to do with your addiction.' "

The type is still unknown (genetic sequencing not ready yet) but it is either hypermobile, vascular, classical-like or classical, in this order of probability (according to the rheumatologist). My beighton score is 9/9 and my joint hypermobility is worse on my lower limbs (but present in my whole body).\n\nRight before I started T the endocrinologist had me do blood tests and hand x-rays. I asked him if there was any chance of me growing in heigh or foot size and he said it was basically impossible because my bones were already fully developed.\n\nWhen I started T I was 5\'4"", now I\'m 5\'6"", so small difference there, but my feet were size 5.5(male chart), now they\'re size 9. I can\'t even put old shoes on, it won\'t even squeeze in.\n\nMy endocrinologist was quite puzzled at the time and said he didn\'t know why I had grown. I haven\'t been there in a couple of months, so I haven\'t been able to ask him if it could be because of the increased joint laxity caused by EDS, but in any case there\'s probably less than 20 people with EDS in the city I live in (Not in the US btw) and the chance of the endocrinologist having ever had or heard about another trans patient with EDS are very small. My mom\'s a gastroenterologist and in almost 25 years of career she has never had a patient with EDS even though it causes GI issues.\n\nDoes anyone have any ideas if that could be a factor?' "

There are a couple of cases where a person whose biological father left the person's mother during pregnancy meets their father after decades and begins a relationship. I don't see anything wrong with that. It gets more complicated if there was a parent-child relationship at some point.\n\nAbout the biohazard aspects of beastiality, necrophilia and cannibalism: there isn't much direct study on any of those for ethical reasons,  most of the studies that do exist are either based in other species or based in data gathered from known cases, almost none of which were in a controlled environment, so not very reliable. Also, it would depend a lot on the amount of people doing it.\n\nIt's very difficult to know whether there would be interspecies transmission of STDs if a lot of people started having sex with their dogs. It's not only uncommon for people to do that, it is also extremely unlikely that someone would admit to doing it, so there isn't much data about it. There's also the risk of infections that aren't STDs but are increased when you have sex with an animal bc of the contact of fluids.\n\nNecrophilia has the decomposition factor, so it isn't just a matter of diseases transmitted through the sex itself, there's also the risk of many other types of infections. Bodies start decomposing very quickly and it's not the same in every body.\n\n(I'm not mentioning the stuff about family bc that's way more complex and there's a whole debate about who should have the power over what happens to the body).\n\nCannibalism is probably the most problematic in terms of biohazard because diseases that spread through eating can become a really big problem really fast. All food industries have very strict regulations (meat even more so) so that food is safe to eat, and that's not possible if you're eating another human who had autonomy and lived their live in a not controlled environment. Many places don't even allow cattle to be fed any animal products bc of the risk of zoonosis. Human cannibalism is rare so there aren't many studies about the diseases one could get from eating human meat and/or internal organs.\n\nBoth cannibalism and necrophilia also have added risks depending on how much contact with the body the person doing those things has and some additional risks depending on whether the body has been embalmed (mostly for necrophilia, I don't think people that are into cannibalism would want to eat an embalmed body), how the person died, how much time has passed since the person died and many, many more things that increase or decrease the risk (and some might increase the risk at a personal level but decrease at a society level or vice versa). There's no way of knowing everything the person did in life and, well, you can't exactly ask a corpse whether they had any diseases. \n\nThere's also the thing about regulating all of this, which would be very difficult to do.""

Parents (in general, obviously there are exceptions) are authority figures to their children and they have a very significant influence in their children\'s opinions, so there will always be *some* level of influence on the decision to have sex with them. \n\nWhen the incest is between siblings (or cousins or other ""same level"" relations), there can still be a power imbalance that is directly proportional to the difference in age and there\'s the issue with the possibility of having children together (birth control can fail, condoms can break, so not necessarily intentionally having children) bc of recessive genetic disorders, but other than that it\'s mostly cultural and in my opinion not *inherently* unethical (I think it\'s weird af but not objectively unethical).\n\n\nBestiality: again, imo there\'s 2 categories. Female animals (or penetrating male animals) and being penetrated by a male animal.\n\nIn both categories the animal can\'t consent, that\'s already a reason for it to be unethical.\n\nThe first category also has the issue that not every animal can communicate pain, discomfort and things like that and can\'t understand consequences.\n\nAlso, it\'s unhygienic and has a lot of potential for interspecies transmission and generation of STDs, so it\'s a huge biohazard.\n\n\nNecrophilia (when consented before death): extremely unhygienic, potential biohazard in many ways but imo not inherently unethical in terms of the corpse itself (still unethical bc biohazard affects society)\n\n\nCannibalism depends on if the person is alive or not. \n\nIf not alive (and not being killed for that specific reason) same issues as necrophilia \n\nIf alive there\'s a whole ethical dilemma regarding one\'s ability to consent to being killed or having pieces cut off. Mostly, if a person is willing to consent, they certainly have a serious mental disorder and are therefore unable to give consent. \n\nIf it involves the killing of the person there\'s also the added layer of practical issues regarding proving that the person agreed to it (which they can\'t bc if they do that means they\'re not mentally able to so no consent)' "

Therefore, the law has to establish criteria for either conviction (criminal) or liability (civil).\n\nThe criteria is stricter for criminal court because it involves taking a right (freedom) from a person. In a case that goes to both criminal and civil court the ruling on either case is not dependent on the other. \n\nAn example: You trespass on a property that belongs to a company and destroy the handrails of a staircase. Let's say one of the workers there saw that the handrails were destroyed, dismissed that information and decided to still climb the stairs, even though there were other possible routes, and got injured. It is clear you committed a crime. It is also clear that you are liable for the damage to the handrails. The injury is more complicated though, because you didn't force the worker to climb those stairs. Even if you are convicted in criminal court, civil court can rule that you are only liable for the handrails. \n\nAbout the evidence, both courts have to have evidence to make a decision. The only difference is that the criminal court has to have evidence beyond a reasonable doubt (so anything that leaves a doubt results in not guilty) and the civil court has to have evidence enough that the possibility that you caused the damage is greater than the possibility that you didn't (so a 90% certainty wouldn't impede a ruling in favor of the person being sued)"" "

I also take levothyroxin and sertralin daily.\n\nToday I read the drug info on the codeine and it said that it's not supposed to be taken with benzos. I took the clonazepam three hours ago and the codeine half an hour ago (before reading that). I have taken both before (a couple of days ago) and felt nothing unusual. Should I be worried and go to the ER or can I just call my doctor tomorrow and ask for another medication?"" "
