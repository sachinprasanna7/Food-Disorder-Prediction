And like first time I eat during the day leads right to the non-stop eating because ""why not I already ruined everything""/ eating makes me feel something/good so why not to continue and eat everything 🤷🏻‍♀️ "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject16, Anxiety causing hallucinations , 2021-08-14 07:37:37 , reddit post ," Hi!
My friend told me that when she goes to sleep, she starts to get really anxious and starts to ""see"" something in shadows/shadows moving etc and it scares her really bad.
Sometimes when things are really bad she can't sleep before morning.
She has tried sleeping lights on etc but it doesn't help, only when she sees that its morning she isn't so scared anymore and can sleep.
Her therapist said (she isn't in therapy anymore because time run out) that its because of anxiety but didn't give any help or doesn't wanted to discuss why that is happening.
Does anyone have anything similar or help or tips for this problem?
Thank you already for reading ❤️ "

I just moved to new city, closer to my friends and they want to have movie night tomorrow. And they are overly excited to get some chips and candies and stuff and I'm f*cking terrified, I have been crying since last night because I'm so scared of tomorrow. I tried to suggest that we could make proper food or something instead of snacks but they are going to eat before movie night and they insisted that they want to have ""proper"" movie night and... Well they are so excited and I don't want to ruin their night just because of my problems 😞 and yeah I love chips and candies and stuff but I know that if I buy something I will eat everything right away and feel sick but I can't go purge after it.
In past I have tried to buy smaller amounts candies and chips but I can't control myself in the shop, i have total black and white thinking style like all or nothing and I don't know, Im just panickin so bad 😞😞 "

And of course we always talk how likely is it I'm going to do it, how my feelings are towards everything and he always emphasize that I can always text or call him if I start to feel like execute my plans. We also talk about why I feel like planning suicide and what reasons I have to not execute my plans but he emphasize the fact that it is ""ok"" daydream about it because it can help me to keep my mind stable, I don't know how to describe it but there's something soothing to plan and daydream about my suicide 😅😅 "

I struggled a lot in school because some subjects were ""mean"" and other ""nice"" and I didn't want to give attention to ""mean"" one 🙈 and in math some calculations (example Divisions) were ""mean"" and it was really difficult to calculate them 😅😅
And nowadays I see some of my mugs and plates mean and other (which are same design) are nice, it's so frustrating 🙈🙈 "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject16,, 2021-03-11 10:18:55 , reddit post ," It took little bit over 4 years me to cry at front of my T. Like after 2-3 years there were moments where I was almost crying but I just shutted down and usually went somewhere far away in my head to escape whole situation. First times when I were crying it was pretty much just teardrops and at the same time I shutted down but I was still crying and little by little I started crying and staying in touch of the subject/surroundings. Of course I took a lot steps backwards when we needed to change to phone therapy cos covid but for the past months I have been able to cry again, it's little bit more awkward to me but at the same time little bit easier because I'm not worrying how I look 🙈🙈 "
