eRisk2023-T3_Subject37, b'I think I\xe2\x80\x99m getting the hang of lucid dreaming\xe2\x80\x94except that I\xe2\x80\x99m incredibly stupid in them' , b'2020-01-14 04:12:31' , reddit post ," b'I started trying to LD about a month ago (dream journaling, reality checks, and occasional meditation) and have recently been pretty successful. I\xe2\x80\x99ve had three full-blown LDs (where I was fully aware and could control my surroundings) in the past two weeks, and many more where I was at least aware that I was in a dream. Last night I succeeded in my first induction method (SSILD), which I won\xe2\x80\x99t talk about for now.\n\nHowever, I have a persistent problem in these dreams: my IQ seems to decrease in half the normal amount while I\xe2\x80\x99m in them. I consistently make stupid choices while I\xe2\x80\x99m LDing that make me groan after I wake up, because I know I could\xe2\x80\x99ve done something way cooler and ruined the opportunity.  The things I\xe2\x80\x99ve attempted while I was lucid include:\n\n-Buying a new pair of headphones so that I can bring them back to my waking life, because the ones I have irl are broken\n\n-Summoning a bunch of food and eating them because I can\xe2\x80\x99t get fat if the food isn\xe2\x80\x99t real\n\n-Doing laundry and washing dishes because I\xe2\x80\x99m too lazy to do them in real life\n\n\nSo, I guess my question is: how to be less stupid while I\xe2\x80\x99m dreaming? I get that you\xe2\x80\x99re not supposed to be in the same exact mental state as when you\xe2\x80\x99re awake (especially when you\xe2\x80\x99re still a beginner), but even though I hear all these cool stories of people flying through beautiful landscapes, summoning a dream guide, meditating etc. I never think of trying them when I\xe2\x80\x99m actually in a dream, and it\xe2\x80\x99s honestly very frustrating. Is there a way to overcome this?' "
