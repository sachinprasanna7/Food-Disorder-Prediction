eRisk2022-T3_Subject25,, 2021-11-19 11:22:23 , reddit post ," baroque- there was lots of ornamentation because the harpsichord didn't have a way to sustain notes and the composers needed to find a way to make the pieces interesting. since the harpsichord strings are plucked and not hit, there was no way to use dynamics and therefore baroque music has very little or limited use of dynamic control. there would be a shorter range (yet again because of the harpsichord). a contrapuntal texture. a flowing, simple melody. will have a continuo.

classical-regular structure, mainly homophonic texture, diatonic harmony, sometimes the use of an alberti base.

romantic- lots of dynamics, rubato, use of the pedal, rich chords, thick texture, dramatic.

if i'm not too late, i hope this helps ! :) "
