eRisk2022-T3_Subject17, Incident in a Ghostland is finally on Netflix! , 2021-11-07 14:40:24 , reddit post ," It's been on Shudder for a while but now that it's more accessible on Netflix, I super recommend this movie. It's directed by the same guy who made the original Martyrs (french), however Incident in a Ghostland is in English.

This movie is NOT what you think it is. Halfway through, I thought, ""Oh god, they're really doing this?"" But just when I thought this story was super generic, it went sideways completely into something else...

Please check out this one if you haven't. It's twisted, very graphic, and covers one of my worst fears ever.

If you have seen it, let me know what you thought! "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject17,, 2021-10-16 14:11:24 , reddit post ," I enjoyed the movie. But some of it just felt unnecessary subplots that did not move the story forward. For instance, the story line of big and little John that were living in Michael's childhood home. The movie spent a good 15 mins on those characters. Also, the Lonnie character. He just felt so out of place and forced. Finally, the hospital scenes were kind intense and there was too much time spent on creating this town-mob. It did not add much to move the story forward IMO.

I was surprised with how long Kyle Richards lasted. I am a huge housewives fan, have been since the genesis so I was really excited to see her even though she's a terrible actress and thought for sure she'd be one of the first kills. But she lasted a while! Good for her.

I loved the homage to Season of the Witch with the masks. That was a good little throwback.

Overall I enjoyed the film and was really entertained. I just wish there "

I love The Collector and the first 2 Saws because of the traps. My fave themes are traps/""games"", home invasion, and well-executed cults (like hereditary, it's my favorite horror and I knew it the moment i saw it), here are my suggestions:

If you haven't watched Haunt, you might enjoy that. Incident in a Ghostland is another favorite of mine kind of in this space. Terrifier is another that I was surprised with and it's certainly torturey. You might like The Poughkeepsie Tapes, that one is FUCKED.

When the crash happened, the bank and subsidiaries literally sold off the notes (debt) to random debt collectors or whatever that went out of business, then those debt collectors sold the notes off AGAIN to other debt collectors and so on.
Meanwhile, deutsche bank is getting ""quantitative easing"" as you call it. People weren't able to pay their mortgage because they literally did not know who owned it. Their mortgages were floating in Limbo, accruing interest and fees for years and years.. and the banks faced no consequences "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject17,, 2021-02-01 20:23:17 , reddit post ," Also it's a huge issue that the lenders and subsidiaries were able to simply vanish and sell off the debt to debt collector companies, not even notifying the actual borrowers.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject17,, 2021-02-01 18:32:07 , reddit post ," It doesn't change the fact that millions of families saw their property values tank while the big lenders and their subsidiaries quietly closed and sold off the debts and collateral to debt collectors.

My last job was a debt collector at a holdings company. I literally saw this happen: we would contact borrowers who took out a second mortgage in 2005 for example. they'd pay on time  every month. Then suddenly, in 2007-2008, their payments were being returned. No mail or contact from the lender (or subsidiary). There would be no assignment of mortgage in public records, for YEARS...

Until they heard from someone like me. And I would have to tell them, that they still owe this balance, PLUS any unpaid interest and late fees on top of the principal. Oftentimes this would be an additional 10-30% of their original principal balance.
If there was equity in the home, and they would not want to pay us? Their file was sent to our legal team to begin foreclosure.

If there wasn't equity, we would have to continue calling and attempt to collect.

I only realized wtf happened in my last months. The big lenders and their subsidiaries just vanished, and the borrowers were stuck to foot the Bill.

Whether these huge lenders were bailed out in one sum or NOT, does NOT change the fact that not a single person was put in jail for this. Americans suffered, and continue to suffer, period "

This sucks really bad, and I'm panicking because the last time I claimed my weeks, I stated that I had been hired by ""aforementioned"" company.

Obviously I would not claim the week I just worked from last Monday to today, given that I was paid today. But while I find another job, am I able to still claim my weeks (or supplement income) even though I was fired? "

He was wasted (a after promising he wouldn't) and he tried to open the car door (passenger side) while I was driving us home going 80mph on the interstate. He smashed my dashboard buttons and was throwing things in my car out the window. When we got off the exit, we were stopped at the red light in a right turn lane and he opened the window and stuck his body out to scream at other cars at the light. It was so embarrassing.

If you're wondering what started it: I didn't want to listen to loud music on the drive home. I was totally sober (like usual) and he was belligerent, blackout drunk. He even called me a ""talentless, useless lazy c*nt""

And I literally have all 45 mins of it on recording!!! Not even kidding. I'm not planning to do anything with it and I don't share it with anyone obviously...

Let alone families with kids or sick family members. It's so expensive to exist. The GOP consist of folks that lived in a time where they could simply afford what they needed, for the most part, but also afford fulfillment. Most working class people have to save for several months or years to take a vacation.

I personally struggle with so much anxiety over what needs to be paid next. I feel immense guilt when I do online ""window-shopping"" and put things in a cart that I ultimately cannot afford.

Everything is so expensive. That sounds a bit superficial maybe but, it's gotten to a point where I don't see myself ever having a family or getting married because it will cost xyz. Suddenly, there is a pandemic and millions are faced with unemployment (myself included, as of 4/2)... The additional $600/week is at the VERY least, helping people stay afloat amid this devastation. I am so scared for what's next, when most of us can't get a job that pays enough to cover it all, again.

Meanwhile, the wealthiest people in the country continue to line their pockets, and it's infuriating how little has been done to protect the citizens that line those pockets. I think everyone should get the $600/week, hell I think people deserve way more than that. "

The $600/week checks are a GOOD thing for people that have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. There are simply not enough jobs, and from my personal experience the jobs I am finding are seldom 1) full time and 2) offering more than $14/hr. Is that not enraging to you?

Let alone the fact that people have fucking debts; hospital bills, credit card bills, car loans, home loans, etc... The additional $600/week is giving Americans a chance to BREATHE "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject17,, 2020-04-28 11:18:39 , reddit post ," The comedian Chris D'Elia briefly touched on this subject in his most recent Netflix standup. He begins with sharing that he has never ever *tried* alcohol or drugs. As in, has never tried even once. He continues to explain that there was not a specific motivation or ""commitment"" (as in religion, illness, addiction, etc) behind this choice; he simply never was interested.

He also advises that his parents took more understanding approach, like, ""We don't want you doing drugs and drinking but we can't control what you do, we just want you to be safe and come to us if you need help."" So, he did not feel compelled to rebel whereas, some parents may approach their children with ""fear"" and ""punishment"" when discussing these topics.

At the end of the day, if you want your kid to trust you to come to you if they need help, then I would encourage building that trust on both ends; your child will never risk endangering themselves knowing they are safe with you, and vice versa trusting you have provided your child with the tools and you trust they are making good choices.

If your team works a lot of parties, ceremonies, conventions, etc. events that celebrate with alcohol, then they will likely ask your team for this same work again. At some  point could involve serving alcohol.

I read your edit and found it interesting to conflate alcoholism with religion. No way that a recovering alcoholic would be trusted with a company card to pick up and move $15k worth of alcohol. Lol "

otherwise YTA if you offered to be a volunteer but decline to assist with work they need done.

I mean he didn't talk about NICOTINE one time in the first 10 mins; the fact that he's a Juul co-founder reeaaaaaallllly makes sense now. He talks about how smoking is perceived as sexy and glamorous. That smokers don't ""enjoy"" smoking, they enjoy ""what it brings them"" (socially...? I guess?)

Like no mf, smokers are addicted to NICOTINE. [The critically acclaimed book by Allen Carr, ""The Easy Way to Stop Smoking"" ](https://www.amazon.com/Allen-Carrs-Easy-Stop-Smoking/dp/0615482155) heavily discouraged against nicotine replacement to quit smoking, because nicotine is what smokers need to kick to quit smoking successfully.

I am only now seeing how a lot of their business practices and things they specifically asked me to do through vague explanations were very shady. But, I also don't really know how it is to be a small business owner in this climate, and maybe some small businesses to kick off, it's more convenient to kind of skirt the law in a ""illegal-but-not-totally-illegal"" way? Like cutting corners?

I don't think they, like, deliberately MEANT to fuck me over _all along_, but they made promises they couldn't keep (and it was my own fault for trusting in people who were very convincing, and made me feel like I would be taken care of no matter what) and I was collateral damage along the way.

""The last of the creameries manufacturing the centuries-old Wensleydale cheese were teetering on the edge of closure in the early '90s, until they received a chance mention in A Grand Day Out. Noticing the increased interest, the creamery persuaded Aardman Animation to endorse a Wallace and Gromit-branded cheese, which worked to rebuild Wensleydale into a thriving product worldwide.""

I was so excited for beach house and didn't know what to expect, because their first three albums were so chill, granted Bloom had just been released the year before.

They played a lot of stuff from Teen Dream and some Devotion (and ofc Bloom) and they were surprisingly bumpin'!!! Very danceable and fun! I had an amazing, unforgettable time. It was not extremely packed because The Cure was about to play at one of the main stages behind me, so most people were like sardines in that area  waiting.

It was just fantastic, they had a bunch of lights going on and Victoria just looked like she did not give a FUCKKK, she was so unphased. I remember someone in the crowd yelled out, ""Look at her, she doesn't even care about us!"" (in like a funny way)

 I also remember when they came out, Victoria was like, ""We're beach house."" And they just started playing. I don't remember what they opened with unfortunately. It might have been Zebra.

Anyway, I had so much fun, I danced and cried (ahem, molly). I got really close to the stage cuz I'm short as heck.

TL;DR surprisingly more dancey than you think, very intimate, and surrounding yourself with true fans makes it so much more fun. "

Her mom had given her some pepper spray for protection I guess, and she was messing around with it to see if it really worked.

The nozzle was directly facing me and she sprayed and it got in my eyes.

Then she felt bad and sprayed herself in the eyes.

And we were like two blind teenagers walking around downtown, in pain.

After a few hours of agony, I decided to google what we should do and the internet said to put milk in the eyes. So we did. And it worked.

ok but that's not what #metoo is really about, at least not necessarily?

women are coming forward about being sexually harassed, assaulted and abused.. it's a scary thing, but a brave thing.

when it involves someone with money, because money is _power_ these days, it's not to be taken lightly by any means... and questioning whether it's for ""fame"" or ""financial"" reasons is not okay. this is called ""victim blaming"" and it's a big reason why many women don't come forward about their sexual abuse/harassment.

what's happening in the news is a really big deal,  because now people who have otherwise been extremely successful in their careers are being called out for their crimes.

to trivialize the awful experiences of women coming forward by insisting that some women ""exaggerate"" and ""ruin innocent men's lives"" is frankly dangerous.

Stassi should say she's SORRY, first of all, and admit she was wrong to do what she did. we all know she's going to backtrack, but I may have a half-ounce of respect for her if she were to just use her brain and _do the right thing_ instead of calling people ""assholes"" and ""morons"" as a response.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject17,, 2017-11-24 19:51:24 , reddit post ," fun story: my dad and I were in Vegas and we went to lunch then he took me to get my eyebrow pierced (because I was only 17 and wannabe edgy). He took me to a place called ""The Precious Slut"", kinda bear Fremont St.

When we arrived and went inside, they needed his ID but he couldn't find his wallet. So he left me at The Precious Slut and drove back to the restaurant where we had lunch to see if he'd left it there.

While I was waiting for him to come back, a homeless guy (I learned he was because the employees told me so after he left) that he found a wallet in the parking lot of The Precious Slut and wanted to return it, and sure enough it was my dad's!

I said, ""thank you so much, that's my father's!"" (and at the time I didn't know the right thing to do is to give the guy some cash, of which I had none, and there wasn't any in the wallet either).

So I called my dad and he came back and felt badly because he wanted to ""reward"" the guy for returning it.

A few weeks later, my dad got a call from his bank that someone tried to cash a check in his name made out for $600 for ""returning a lost wallet""

My dad felt even more guilty but I just laughed. Like the guy did something under the guise of being  honorable then really tried to pull this shit? Not a big surprise in Vegas, I guess.  "

• Peters as Jim Jones

well one of the roommates starts (drunkenly) going off on me about how:

I didn't want to be the asshole who goes and tattletales and I also didn't want to miss any of the movie to tattletale, anyway.

For those of you who don't know, Get Out is an R-Rated THRILLER/HORROR.... why are you bringing fucking babies into this movie? The baby was making noises and crying and her guardians/parents kept having to shush her. Then, closer to the front row there was ANOTHER woman with a baby who was fucking crying.

We didn't pay to sit in a theater and not enjoy the movie. Please stop bringing your babies/underage children to movies that are for adults only.  "
