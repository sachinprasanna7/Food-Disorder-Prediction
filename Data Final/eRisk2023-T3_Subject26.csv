Now as to why we see near instant switching between two states: even though they look stable they are actually unstable points, it just takes a long time for the switch to build up. Since the nut is not spinning on a major/minor axis, little rotations not in the main rotation axis affects the main rotation: stealing some angular momentum and energy (this is allowed because we are not on a major/minor axis therefore there are states nearby with the same total angular momentum and energy), the more angular momentum that gets stolen the quicker the stealing happens, once half way through the switching  the balance shifts and the stealing becomes giving until there is no more angular momentum in the non main spinning axes. It\xe2\x80\x99s all a very dynamic process, the motion from the last step affecting the motion in the next step while spinning in multiple axes all coming together whilst conserving angular momentum.\n\nA slightly different but analogous example is imagine a simple pendulum attached to a point with a solid rod. If the pendulum is balanced upside down perfectly it will stay there forever without starting to swing. Now if a single spec of dust hits the pendulum imparting a tiny amount of force; the pendulum will seem to stay in place but actually is slightly unbalanced, overtime it will get pulled more and more downward, quicker and quicker until it begins to visibly swing. It will swing down and around and right back up to the seemingly stable upside down state; gravity slowly but exponentially amplified the instability created by the dust and switches the pendulum from one semi-stable state to the next. In the spinning nut example the two pendulum states are the two semi-stable spinning states and the gravity that caused the state switching is a complicated interplay between the possible spinning axes of the nut and conservation of angular momentum + energy.

Also a small note while rpm and angular momentum are related they aren\xe2\x80\x99t the same, for example imagine two near identical spinning fly wheels that are made of different density materials say wood and steel: the steel wheel has more angular momentum than the wood because there is more mass spinning even though the angular speed is the same.

It was only the bottom-right corner of the flag that moved. \n\nWhile yes they will feel similar forces, they will not all feel forces in the same direction, the forces will be radial outwards from the astronaut, so the effective turning forces will not be evenly distributed. This difference in turning forces will cause the dragging I mentioned and also dissipate energy in the form compression of the material, ripples in the fabric and heat formation.\n\n> Do you know how I could do this for, say, the bottom-right corner of the flag? \n\nWell, the thing about moments of inertia is they are dependant on the total geometry of the object in question. You are on the right track by thinking of just one segment but what moments of inertia allow us to do is take into consideration all these minute pieces of fabric and how they interact with one another, the moment of inertia is defined by summing distribution of all infinitesimal pieces of mass so one can consider all of the object instead of just a corner. (Although intuitively I see where you are coming from, rotational dynamics can be unintuitive and your calculation/model is very very simplistic and runs the risk of being a very bad estimation of the total motion) Using the moment of inertia and the force ""profile"" on the flag one can determine how the flag shall move as a whole.\n\n> To be honest, I just want to be able to say that it\'s at least possible that static force moved the flag. \n\nOh, there most definitely was a contribution from the static force, the reality is our models are just that, models, all of the possible reasons for the motion described in your source contributed something to the motion of the flag, not just 1 singular thing. But the thing about physics and analyzing phenomena is that most of these contributions can be seen as negligible compared to one or two of the main driving forces in play, physicists often use their intuition and ""back of the envelope"" calculations to try to determine what could have realistically been the main cause (Although in this case maybe they did run many different scenarios computationally to determine the conditions required for each scenario). In your source they say ""not likely"", this doesn\'t mean that there was no static force or that the static force did not cause the motion but that the circumstances in which the static forces were the main contribution (having a 10kV potential difference between the hand and flag for example) is unlikely compared to other options.'

eRisk2023-T3_Subject26, b' ' , b'2020-03-25 15:23:47' , reddit post ," b'A few things about your general calculations/concepts that I feel would need working on in order to make a full model that I got by skimming your post:\n\n>it\'s just necessary (I think) to divide this impulse by the mass of the small flag section to find the velocity in meters per second that the flag section would end up with.\n\nThis ignores the fact that the flag is one large solid object, while yes if it was just this small segment taking the entire force it would end with a velocity similar to what you calculated given your assumptions we must take into consideration that the flag segment\'s motion is being dampened and impeded by the fact that it is ""dragging"" the rest of the flag with it. In order to get a full model of the motion one would need to take into account the dynamics of the flag as a whole, this impulse would propagate and dissipate throughout the entire flag and not just the singular segment which gives much different final velocities/dynamic profile of what\'s going on.\n\nA better simplistic model one could try using is assuming the flag is a rigid cuboid which can only rotate about the flag pole axis. One can then say that the flag acts as a rigid rod with some spring/restoring force which tries to pull the flag back to its natural resting position (not sure how one would find such a constant simply other than through empirical testing or more advanced 3d simulations of the flag) and the electromagnetic force felt at every segment of the flag. While I do like your idea use of impulses, when it comes to more complicated dynamic systems like this one would probably have to use green\'s functions to calculate the motion after applying the impulses, it\'s probably easier to calculate the total energy that the electric force applies and convert it all to rotational energy in this model. By doing this one can calculate the rotational velocity of the flag for any given moment in time (the full dynamics of this simple flag system).\n\n>In the moon\'s gravity 249 grams would be 41.17 grams.\n\nMass is a body\'s tendency to resist motion, this is irrelevant of what planet you are on, the only thing that changes on different planets is the gravitational acceleration felt not the mass of the object so a flag which is 249 grams on earth is 249 grams on the moon and 249 grams on Jupiter etc. as the flag is still made of the same amount of ""stuff"" which is what gives it its mass, things in space don\'t lose their mass because there is no gravitational body around, they will still be ""resistant"" to other types of forces which is what mass is. If one was to use the primitive model I described above you would need to calculate the flags moment of inertia which is the rotational analogue to mass, an object\'s ""resistance"" to rotation/torques.\n\n​\n\nBut overall I find it unlikely that the static electricity is the cause and the other options outlined in the journal you linked are more likely just due to one fact: the energy that an electric field can exchange at such distances and at such a scale is minuscule compared to the energy it takes to make a 250g flag swing as shown in the video, at least that\'s what my intuition from working in physics for many years is telling me without doing the calculations explicitly.'

To arrive at GR and have any semblance of the why or reasoning other than just accepting the maths that arise from the postulates of Einstein takes years and years of Physics; most people aren't even equipped with the mathematics to touch GR at a Masters level.""

eRisk2023-T3_Subject26, b'How to get chlorophyte ore and any other item!' , b'2014-04-22 17:13:26' , reddit post , b'I have recently discovered how to change item ids using the bug with piggy banks. If you are unfamiliar with this bug all of your piggy banked items turn into stacked iron pickaxes. The number of pickaxes relate to the items id. Since chlorophyte ore is unobtainable in console editions of terraria. I used this new found knowledge about item ids to do good and obtain chorophyte to start farming it. You must first get a rope and a piggy bank. Put the rope in the piggy bank and reload your world. Check the piggy bank and you should have 965 iron pickaxes (Because ropes item id is 965). Next take away 18 pickaxes from the stack to make it to a stack of 947 pickaxes (947 is the item id of chlorophyte ore). Now reload the world and in your piggy bank and you should have a piece of chlorophyte ore and possibly any other random items. You can do this with any item as long as you have an item with a higher item id. To find all item IDs go to this page http://terraria.gamepedia.com/Item_IDs'
