I can't ruin this. I can starve myself, scratch my skin till it bleeds, isolate myself and refuse to give myself sleep for no other reason than wanting to hurt me, but I can't cut. I want to, I want to see the shock on the faces of the people around me, I want them to finally take me serious. But they don't. It's easy to look away when there's no blood. No, who am I kidding, they'd still look away if I was laying on the ground, bleeding out. But I wanna be pretty. I already hate the stretch marks on my thighs and butt, if I had cuts it would look even worse. I'd never be able to hide them, cause being the fucking pathetic idiot I am, I need to dress in the shortest, most revealing shit I can find, to make sure I always get the attention and validation I so desperately crave. I fucking hate this"" "

eRisk2023-T3_Subject41, b'Idk if my sports coach just sexually harassed me today' , b'2022-10-11 22:21:39' , reddit post ," b'(the first paragraph isn\'t that important to the story, you can skip it if you just wanna see the part that might be harassment) \n\n\nI\'m 16f, but a lot of people have told me that even though my face matches my age, my body looks older (more developed, especially my chest). In most normal situation that doesn\'t really affect me, I wear what I want to each day, whether that is a deepcut shirt with hotpants or an oversized hoodie and long jeans. However, one situation that definitely makes me very aware of my body is sports. I\'ve been playing with my team for years now, but I still feel like people (especially those from other teams) talk sexualised shit about me, especially since this is a very male dominated sport. This lead to me constantly trying to look as non-sexual as possible when playing/practicing, which includes having my (kinda long) hair in a braid instead of a ponytail, always wearing long leggings and having my sport shirt (idk the name in English, the one that everybody from a team has, with their number and name on it) be multiple sizes too big so that it doesn\'t show my body as much. \n\n\nWe have two coaches, coach A who isn\'t present a lot, mostly just comes with us on competitions and is pretty nice and coach B, who has practice with most times and is rather strict, even though he gives good feedback. But something about him always freaked me out, I just feel like he\'s treating me different than the most girls (even though there aren\'t many other girls to begin with). He\'s called me ""bitch"" multiple times to my face, I think it just slipped out of him the first time, but he still didn\'t apologise and the other times, he didn\'t say anything but even laughed as if it was a funny joke. Remember, I\'m 16 (15 when it first happened) and this guy is in his mid or late 50s. Today, we had to do an exercise where we had to be in push-up position but then ""jump"" with our legs while not having our arms leave our position. While explaining it, he mentioned multiple times that we must not relax our lower body (butt and legs) for even a second for this exercise to be effective, which is a fairly normal comment to make. However, when it was our turn to do it, he went around and watched everybody, but only stopped when he got to me. I wasn\'t the best at it, sure, but I definitely did decent. However, he made a whole point out of coming up next to me, touching my back, saying ""this is okay, right?"" And then, without waiting for an answer, moving his hand down to my butt, kinda just resting it there for a second and saying ""you\'re too relaxed, you can\'t relax it like that"". Then he let go of me and continued to go to the next person. It just freaked me out that this grown ass man would randomly touch my butt like that, especially without properly asking. There were about ten other people around and he made no effort to hide it, which kinda makes me question whether I\'m overreacting?? I\'m sorry for the long post but I just had to get it out.\n\n\nEdit: since a lot of people suggested reporting him to the school, let me clarify that my team has absolutely nothing to do with the school, it\'s independent from any other organisations. I\'m not in the US where most teams are from a school' "
eRisk2023-T3_Subject41, b'(TW: ED) That moment when you join an eating disorder subreddit and immediately get recommended these other subs lmao' , b'2022-09-28 17:39:46' , reddit post , b'' 
eRisk2023-T3_Subject41, b' ' , b'2022-09-28 17:35:25' , reddit post ," b'I think it really depends on why you\'re doing it/what effect it has on you. If you don\'t sleep because you\'re stressed/busy/like being tired/whatever, that\'s self destructive and definitely not healthy, but probably not sh by most definitions. I do it for a variety of reasons, including ""I don\'t think I am worthy of sleep and therefore want to deprive myself of it because it damages me and thus feels like a punishment"" and some other stuff I don\'t really wanna name. Because of those reasons I considered and listed it as a form of sh, but obviously opinions may be different' "

I was looking for a place to vent/maybe get some advice for that, but the main topic of this subreddit seems to be cutting. Are other forms of sh also welcome here? I don't want to invade a safespace that's not mine, if you get me."" "
