I will say that they are *extremely* hard to get a hold of in some areas, so while you can certainly get the prescription through them I would try to get involved with another practice once you get established. Been on T for 5 years and I still have to pull teeth to get that prescription renewed (often in person appointments that I called for 3 weeks to get an answer, any answer. Leaving a message leads me nowhere.) There are two PPs in my immediate area and both are like this. Just a lot of demand and not enough support. And doctors in my area were super transphobic and unwilling, they were my only lifeline which I am grateful for- but they do do this unfortunately.\n\nTLDR: More doctors will be more comfortable prescribing HRT after you get established to the best of my knowledge.
