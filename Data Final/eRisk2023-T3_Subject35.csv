ED is a combination of many unresolved problems, coping mechanisms and trauma respons strategies. When not dealt with emotions can run really high and especially in a relationship. She might need lots of validation, feel insecure, it might affect going out for meals and socialising. Read all you can about it and being there even when there\'s nothing to say, or solve right away. You might experience anger at times and helplessness. If she\'s open for change that\'s good. And there might be fall-backs so what I\'m saying is its not gonna go away just like that...it can take years...keep communicating and don\'t censor your emotions. We learn best from others behaviour and their ability to resolve issues in a healthy way. But we\'re also human, so it\'s ok if you ""fail"" sometimes. \nThis is important for her to see as well.' "

Maybe he really will think about it, mentioning it again is more pressure, guys shot down. We women don\xe2\x80\x99t think of it as pressure but I once told my bf that I wanted him to talk more about himself we\xe2\x80\x99ve together for a long time and I was in an unsatisfied mood and after a few days I felt the urge to bring it up again but after a little thought I decided not to cause I could sense his withdrawal was a reaction of the already presented pressure. I let it pass(it was hard!) but it was a turning point and a revelation cause he came around to be okay with being himself again and have a more natural process of our relationship. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if that makes sense to you but I just thought about if I talked to another woman the same way she would not see it as pressure the same way that they do. Hope it\xe2\x80\x99s not insensitive to your situation just a perception...\xf0\x9f\x98\x85' "
