Plus, even though its a toxic environment, I know my parents love me and they don’t do any of these things in order to purposefully cause me harm or distress. Its that thought that makes me wonder whether I’m strong enough to leave like that, knowing the pain it would cause them.

I deal with my mother's hoarding, which she denies frequently, and both my physical and mental health has taken a toll ever since the pandemic begun since I have little to no ways of escaping this house filled with unnecessary items and trash. She won't even throw out food that is expired...

I've tried to take it upon myself to clean, throw out some of the smaller stuff so she wouldn't notice, but its so minimal that not even I notice the difference and instead just panic at the thought she'll find out. I agree that moving out is the best solution, but what do you suggest people who aren't economically stable (I'm 19 with student debt already) enough to do ? "

I've gotten a lot better with my recovery since then. I stopped one of my habits around 16 and the others haven't fully stopped but I've managed to keep it under control and be, for the most part, healthy.
These past few days though, I've been doing something I've never done before. I was trying on outfits for a small party and I kept getting so frustrated at myself for not looking the way I wanted in the clothes that I began punching my stomach. I even left some bruises :3 I don't know if this can be called a relapse as it doesn't directly have much to do with food and everything to do with body dismorphia. I'm not proud of it, but I also can't say its something I'll never do again..
Has anyone ever experienced something similar? Regardless of the bad days, I really do want to get better, so any and all support is much appreciated. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject28, Do you expect your father (or parents in general) to know the name of your partner's sibling? , 2021-09-07 21:14:51 , reddit post ," Me and my bf have known each other for 4 years and been together for 3 years. His sister and I are friends and I've mentioned her, not constantly, but enough for my dad to at least recognize who I'm talking about when I say her name. And yet, 3 years later, he still asks me who that is.

Its not that I expect him to know every single thing about her and the things we do together, that would make me uncomfortable on a whole other level, but I can't understand how self centered you have to be to not even know the name of who your daughter hangs out with. Just her name. Specially since she isn't just a random friend, but the sister of the man your daughter has been dating for over 3 years.

I don't know if I'm putting too much importance over this, but it bugs me that he doesn't know who I'm referring too in a casual conversation. I'm 21, it shouldn't matter that he doesn't know, but it just reminds me of how little attention he pays to me the times I decide to dedicate the time and patience to speak to him. Then again, he doesn't listen about how I'm doing at university or how I'm feeling, what makes me thing he would listen when I talk about my friends and even more, remember what it is I say. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject28, Is it normal to have roaches in the house? , 2021-04-27 04:51:33 , reddit post ," I know, random question to ask, specially in this subreddit. But I swear there’s a point to this.

So I live with toxic parents (I’m 20 and currently working to getting my own place but money is tight atm). One’s a hoarder, the other has diagnosed anger issues, both are in their own way controlling over me, amongst other problems. Now over the past few weeks, roaches have started to appear over the house (I’ve killed 12 in just over 10 minutes and I wasn’t even able to get to all the ones I saw). I’ve been vocal about my disgust towards this because they’re everywhere. I had to throw out my toothbrush because there was one standing on the brush. My dad’s bought a few generic roach strips with venom, but it’s barely done anything. Surprisingly enough, given his anger issues he’s barely demonstrated any disgust. No more than a regular person would be if he saw insects crawling a tree, which is certainly not the same reaction one should have to dozens of roaches in their home! My mom is pretty nonchalant about it too. She only kills them if she feels like it and if I ask her too cause I can’t alone. So here’s where my question comes in. By the way they’re reacting they are making me feel like I’m blowing this out of proportion and its actually normal to be living like this. So in your opinion, is it? Answer below and thank you :/

Also, please don’t go into too much detail about dangers and whatnot. I’m aware of them and I’m already panicked enough. I guess I’m just looking for some validation as many of us children of toxic parents do. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject28, Mother hoarding food , 2021-04-07 17:03:31 , reddit post ," What the title says :3 my mother hoards food that's been expired for months, sometimes years. She either hides it so nobody notices it or erases the expiration date on the container/bag and puts it in the freezer or fridge. She does hoard so many other things but this is actually harmful to our health you know. I used to be aware of this behavior and simply became extra picky on what I would eat around the house (which I think was a big part of why I developed an ED at 14). Now that I'm older though, I'm not only aware but she also does it in front of me and asks me to keep it a secret from my father. Although its not as if he didn't know, he helps me get new food whenever my S/O comes over cause well, obviously its gross to eat expired food but also because I was ashamed of having him come over and eating anything and he would just be here and be starving the entire time.

She does throw it away if anyone in the house points out that it looks visibly bad (if its rotten or has mold). But even then, she just kinda throws it all together in a container rather than putting it in the trash. And if me or my father take the initiative to throw it out, she looks through the trash and takes it out. We've gone as far as throwing it out in trash cans outside of the house, but I find it ridiculous that we have to go through such lengths to discard food that's just not eatable.

So the point of this is just that I find myself in a bad position because clearly what she's doing isn't okay. I'm 20 years old and at this point I'm just tired of being put in situations where one parent tells me to hide information from the other. ""Oh, don't tell your mom but I threw away all of these things"" and then she finds out and I have to deal with her frustration because we never told her. ""Oh, this is expired but I'm putting it in the freezer and erasing the expiration date so your dad doesn't find out and throws it out"" and then having to deal with the rants of my father who is diagnosed with anger issues. Its mentally draining. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject28, Common or “side effect”? , 2021-03-26 05:46:04 , reddit post ," So I’ve been wondering a lot lately, how do you tear a piece of toilet paper/paper towel? I live with a hoarder parent and its to an extent that we have cockroaches in the house (not a lot but enough for me to see at least 1 or 2 a day). Anyways, I’ve noticed lately that instead of tearing toilet paper/paper towel from the top, I do it from the bottom. Idk if that makes sense.

Take this emoji for instance: 🧻. If you turn the screen to the right you’d see the toilet paper in a different position that you’d see it if the screen is turned to the left. Well, I feel like the most natural way to tear a piece of this would be from the top (if the screen was to the right). Personally, I do it from the bottom (if the screen was to the left). I’m wondering, is this common or is it a “side effect” (for lack of a better word) of my situation? Because the way I see it, by doing it my way I would use the side of the paper that wasn’t exposed to the exterior where insects would have walked over it. But idk if that’s just a common train of thought for everyone, hoarder parent or not.

I’m sorry for not being the best at explaining. :3 "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject28, The Minimalist , 2021-03-22 02:22:33 , reddit post ," So, as a new minimalist, I did (what I feel is) the most cliché thing: I sent a text to The Minimalists to see if they could help guide me with some personal struggles I'm having. To my surprise, they saw it and mentioned it on their podcast. However, they merely read the question and said they would expand on it more in their Maximalist Patreon podcast. I'm really interested in knowing what they have to say on my situation but don't want to pay to listen to just one of their shows (since I don't have the money to pay a constant fee). If I reached out to them, do you think they would give me their insight without me having to join Patreon?

Edit: it was early 2020 and I had just turned 19 when I sent in the question. I was barely starting to understand how minimalism works (and I’m still learning tbh) and had no clue about the existence of Reddit, much less this specific subreddit.

As we learn towards the end of the movie, Snape spent most of the year trying to save Harry. Quirrell himself admits it, which means Voldemort knew as well. I mean sure, Occlumency helped him hide his true motives and his work with the Order, but Voldemort lived through the events of that first movie. He must have known how Snape suspected Quirrell’s intentions and actively defied him to prevent his resurrection, and yet he still took him back as a Death Eater. So, my question is, how did Snape manage to convince Voldemort that he was on his side when Voldemort himself knew he was part of the reason he never got the stone in the first place? "

As a spectator (from one of the lower districts, not the capitol itself) I would have found it incredibly odd that a man who only just met him would save his life, specially under the circumstances of The Games. How come nobody ever questioned Finnick's actions?


Edit: Also, I understand the reason why Finnick did what he did. My question is based in the POV of someone experiencing The Games without knowing about the rebellion plan.  "
