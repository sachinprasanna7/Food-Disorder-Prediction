Would Sims with an OCD trait fixate on stuff like washing their hands to the point of harming themselves of not being able to go to work? Would bipolar Sims in mania not sleep and eat for days?

Are you seeing a psychotherapist or psychiatrists only? Do you think that something like setting reminders to eat multiple times a day on your phone, and eating according to them on more stable days could help you keep this habit during episodes?

I'm not bipolar, but I struggle with mood swings due to BPD and using reminders helps me to keep up with basic self care when they get worse. I never went through a manic episode so my advice might be stupid :(  but I'm here if you need to talk. "

What makes me a bit worried is that quetiapine is anantipsychotic, most often used to treat schizofrenia. It can cause a lot of side effects and is pretty strong. It has sedating effects but it's rarely used just for sleep issues.

I don't experiance psychosis and I already take antidepressants and mood stabilizers so the choice to prescribe me quetiapine seems...odd? Worring? I don't  know.

I used it two times this week and it definitely helps me to fall asleep fast. I haven't experianced any side effects yet but I'm a bit confused with my psychiatrist choice.

I'm bulimic, non-purging subtype and I've been going to therapy for a couple of months. My therapist specializes in CBT and works with me on my borderline personality disorder, she doesn't seem to have a whole lot of experience with eating disorders. She suggests using a food journal, in which I would record what and when I eat, emotions I experience, compensatory behaviors, etc. that we would analyze together during sessions to find patterns in my behavior.

The thought of doing that makes me feel very uncomfortable. Showing my eating habits to another person seems potentially very triggering and I'm afraid it might cause me to restrict harder. I know that my therapist has my best interest in mind but I'm really not sure if I should follow through with the journal.

Most people don't casually murder people/pay for child pornography in their day to day lives, you can criticize those things as loudly and aggressively as you like without offending anybody.

In my mind being vegan is more similar to being anti fast fashion. Most people eat meat/buy unethically made clothes and you absolutely will turn them away by aggressively calling out their contribution to animal suffering and modern slave labour. Guilt is probably the most uncomfortable emotion a person can feel and a lot of people would rather stop listening than feel uncomfortable.

I will never stop speaking out about these issues, but I prefer to not use an accusatory tone - not because I pity meat-eaters so much but because I want as many people as possible to listen. "

I don't have any studies to back it up but I've seen a lot of people in online BPD spaces talking about maladaptive daydreaming. It's not the same thing as dissociation - which, at least in my experience, just kind of pulls you out of reality during times of distress. Maladaptive daydreaming is a more controllable coping mechanism, it doesn't change your perception of reality but can interfere with your life.

Daydreaming for me is a way of working through difficult things and calming myself down. I have to go through the same imaginary scenarios every night just to be able to fall asleep. I talk to myself and pretend I'm talking to my imaginary friends and often spend hours imagining I'm an idealized version of myself or someone else entirely. I know that I should be doing more productive things but distracting myself (by daydreaming, listening to music, drinking etc.) is the only thing standing between me and a complete meltdown. "

Psychiatrists can be extremely difficult to talk to, it's not unreasonable to feel like you're being judged by the way certain questions are being asked during the appointment. But they're not judging you. Most likely, they really want to help you. The end goal of this process is to make you feel and function better and that can be achieved even without a diagnosis. I understand, that putting a name on your pain can be very important (it definitely is for me), but you really can get better without naming it.

Also, remember that all professionals sometimes make mistakes and can miss seemingly obvious things. People often have to go through several incorrect diagnoses before settling on the right one. My first therapist couldn't see anything wrong with my mental health and told me to just work on my self-esteem lol

I would argue that many people in the fitness industry have (and promote) disordered eating habits and often count calories more for esthetic reasons than actual health.

You might disagree with me on this, and it's fine if you do, but in my ideal world, people wouldn't focus on weight or calories. Society's obsession with thinness was a big part of me developing bulimia and I don't want anyone, ever to go through what I experience everyday. "

I think it's fair to say that a lot of weight/body related EDs are based on *some* fatphobic beliefs.

Rationally, I deeply believe that being fat says nothing about a person's worth, that fat people face awful discrimination, that fat bodies are beautiful...yet I irrationally fear being fat myself. As much as I hate to admit it, some part of me IS fatphobic.

The only symptoms of BPD that I don't experience are the ones most associated with this disorder: frantic efforts to avoid abandonment and difficulty controlling anger.

My childhood wasn't perfect, I have dealt with anxiety and eating disorders since age 9, my family situation was confusing and my emotions were often invalidated but it wasn't anything out of ordinary. I was never abused in any way.

What caused my BPD was probably an unlucky combination of natural sensitivity, invalidating environment and a history of mental illness in my family.

This idea that everyone with BPD has a history of abuse is kinda...hurtful to me, I guess? It makes me feel like an imposter, like my experiences aren't valid, like my pain isn't strong enough. I know this wasn't your - or anyone else's - intent, I'm just very sensitive about stuff like that. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject6,, 2020-11-30 14:15:44 , reddit post ," I really don't like this demonization of narcissism (or rather narcissistic personality disorder) that seems to happen every time someone on the internet acts in an unlikable way. NPD is a very serious, very painful mental health issue, one that is often co-morbid with depression, anxiety and substance abuse and often stems from a difficult or abusive childhood. Throwing a label of a personality disorder on anyone you don't like is just adding to the stigmatization of mental illnesses.

Anyway, speaking as someone actually diagnosed with a personality disorder: while narcissism can't be cured, its symptoms can be managed through a lot of psychotherapy. Narcissistic people most often don't seek help for narcissism itself, but for some of the more painful symptoms. So, yes, many people with NPD are in therapy. "

Sometimes I just look at pictures of famous people, wondering whether I want to be them or be with them.
