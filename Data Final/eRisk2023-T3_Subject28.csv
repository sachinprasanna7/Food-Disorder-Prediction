I've been feeling a little more motivated and happy i think, but im having trouble coming to terms with that because i havent been okay or happy or motivated or wanting to be here for a long time so it feels weird not feeling that way all the time. Its like some part of me doesn't think I deserve to feel better bc I got so used to being unhappy. If you read this thank you for listening. \xe2\x9d\xa4\xef\xb8\x8f"" "
