When a student knows the worth and the weight of the knowledge they\xe2\x80\x99re receiving, they put more time, energy and effort into writing it down, digging deeper and memorising. Or less, depends on the student themself. Math is important not only to find out how much your bacon costs in the store with -25% off, it\xe2\x80\x99s also for logical and tactical thinking, it introduces us to physics, paradoxes, and such phenomena as equality, balance, and etc. This knowledge is pretty mandatory and as far as I know people who put time and effort to understand the rules of math (not necessarily sitting till 2 am trying to solve the square root of 82847472, as an example), are a lot more logical and have a better perception of most situations involving risks. That\xe2\x80\x99s why we\xe2\x80\x99re encouraging our students, especially those preparing for exams, to dedicate 95% of their studying time into formulas and their relativity with other equations, knowing how and when to use the formulas.'
