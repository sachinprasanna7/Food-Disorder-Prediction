Both my roommate and I had experiences, including with a whole room full of our friends. This was my first experience with our ghost roommate. \n\nI was in a musical revue at the time and would come home with full show makeup and hair done every night around 9 pm. This was our first night in the place. For reference, we were on the second floor above the laundry room. You could feel a person\'s footsteps on the balcony out front before they got to the door because the place was so flimsily built. My roommate was my high school best friend, a 200+ lb, 6\'2"" flamboyant bear of a guy.\n\nMy roommate was still at work when I got home. I had made a beeline for the bathroom to wash off my make-up. While I was washing my face, I felt heavy footsteps walk up to our front door, heard the key turn the lock, and felt the front door open and close. Then I felt those same heavy footfalls come down the hall and felt a presence standing behind me. Doing my best to rinse my eyes thoroughly, I said, ""Hi, Jeff! Give me a minute."" Once my face was rinsed, I looked up to greet him, only to find that there was no one there. \n\nThis exact pattern happened every night that first week. Finally, I had had enough of it. After the now familiar experience of hearing/feeling the footfalls up to the door, the door unlock, open and close, the footsteps coming down the hall, and the presence behind me, I calmly finished washing my face and looked into the mirror, right where a tall man\'s face would be. I looked right at where I felt he was and said, ""Hi, my name is buddhagrrl and the other guy is Jeff. We\'re your new roommates. I don\'t mind you being here, but this is really freaking me out and I\'d like you to stop. Thanks.""\n\nIt never happened again and he never showed himself to me as aggressively again. \n\nI was sober, and not prone to hallucinations.

Due to a history of an unprovoked pulmonary embolism and high blood pressure, I'm not a candidate for HRT.\n\nI don't have pain in EVERY joint, but I was diagnosed with run of the mill arthritis at 45. At 49, I'm down to bone on bone in my knees and everywhere I had mild arthritis is much, much worse. I guess it's the lack of estrogen? \n\nI also have bad brain fog and was recently diagnosed with ADHD. Something about late peri made those symptoms worse. I'm trying to get medication for the ADHD in hopes that I can get some of my snap back.\n\nI had been gluten free for 10+ years prior to the pandemic but, thanks to stress eating have fallen off the wagon. I will say that the systemic inflammation is worse when I eat gluten, sugar, and dairy. I guess I need to get back on that wagon.\n\n I don't bounce back from sleep deprivation like I used to.\n\nI was having crazy mood swings on top of all this, but that has settled down the closer to official menopause I get. \n\nThings I take that seem to help:\n\nAshwaghanda - very effective for anxiety and depression, also good for balancing estrogen dominance \n\nD.I.M - a phytoestrogen derived from cruciferous vegetables, it acts as a very weak HRT. My hot flashes are better when I take it.\n\nTurmeric (Meriva by Thorne) - this is as powerful an anti-inflammatory as NSAIDs for me. Meriva is the gold standard for turmeric supplements- it's what they use in studies of the benefits of turmeric. I can't take NSAIDs because of my medications, so this is what I take.\n\nQuerticin - it helps with pain brought on by low estrogen. It has to build up in the system I've found and doesn't work well if I take it inconsistently.\n\nMagnesium glycinate - I think that's what it's called? Magnesium helps with muscle stiffness and pain. If you're waking up with cramping calves in the middle of the night, you need this. \n\nVitamin D - I had my kids in my late 30s and breast fed well into my 40s. I had my blood levels checked because of extreme fatigue and I was pathologically low so now I supplement. It helps. \n\nVitamin B complex - as we age, our bodies don't hold on to B vitamins as well and don't extract them from food as efficiently. Good for brain fog and fatigue\n\nIron - have your ferritin levels checked in addition to your regular iron  levels. Anemia is more common in older women and low iron contributes to the brain fog/fatigue.\n\nHope that helps. Sorry for the novel.\n\nEDIT: Forgot a supplement, lol. Also added spacing.\n\nCollagen - we don't produce as much naturally after estrogen declines, and the lack of collagen makes tendons more brittle and prone to injury as well as causing skin to sag and appear older. This helps. My supplement contains hyaluronic acid, which makes tissues more juicy and resilient, too."" "

The house had even been declared a landmark by the state, with a plaque that claimed the house had been built in 1640.\nThe summer when I was 10 years old, I stayed with my grandparents, whose property was adjacent to my Great Aunt I.I.\'s. It was about a quarter mile hike to get to her house from theirs. \n\nI.I. invited me to stay the night with her one time but she warned me that she had a ghost in her upstairs who LOVED children, so I was likely to get a visit. I thought she was messing with my head and didn\'t think much of it. \n\nShe set me up in one of her upstairs guest rooms, just down the hall from her bedroom. I had settled in and gone to sleep. Deep in the night, I have no idea what time, I awoke to a soft glow in the hallway under the door of my room and the sound of soft footfalls creaking in the hall outside. At first I thought it was my aunt, but the steps kept pacing back and forth and the soft glow was moving with the footsteps, up and down the hall. I began to get nervous, rembering I.I.\'s warning about the ghost. I turned over in bed so that I couldn\'t see the moving glow in the hall and looked out the window next to my bed, trying to ignore the footsteps and fell asleep again. \n\nA while later, I awoke to my bedroom door creaking open and my room was lit by that soft glow, like someone had come in carrying a candle. I felt a cold chill on my back and tensed up with fear, shutting my eyes tight. I feel a gentle hand begin to stroke my hair away from my face. I thought maybe it was I.I. so I open my eyes and look around. The room is lit with the candlelight glow, but there is no visible source. I lay back down, eyes squeezed shut tight. The sensation of the hand stroking my head comes back and I hear a gentle, ""shhhh."" Then I feel a soft kiss on my forehead and I was filled with this deep sense of love and peace. The glow left the room and I was able to fall asleep right away. \n\nI stayed over with I.I. a couple of other times during that summer and would hear the footsteps in the hall and see the soft glow that went with them in the hall each time, but she never came into my room again, that I was aware of. I think she didn\'t want to scare me.' "

Like you, I think I'm a bit sensitive to things like this. \nThe creepiest one in recent memory was at the clinic where I work as a massage therapist. The mixed use shopping complex I work in was built on old Mental Health State Services land and they had to move a few graves from a little cemetary that was on the property to build the shopping center. \nVariations of this have happened throughout the 10 years I've worked there: lights switching off mid session, the ceiling fan turning off, etc. We all joke about out resident ghost. \nSo I'm in the middle of a massage, (thankfully the client was face down during the activity) when the ceiling fan clicks up to its highest setting. It's going faster than I've ever seen it go. My hands are on the client, so I had no way to accidentally change the speed. Suddenly the fan stops dead like someone stopped it with their hand. It doesn't slow down, just goes from full tilt boogie to an standstill instantly. Then it starts going in the opposite direction just as fast as before. I'm trying to not let the client be aware of how much I'm freaking out. They tell me they're cold which gives me an excuse to shut off the fan completely. The lights flicker once after this, then things are back to normal.\nNow, these fans do have remotes, which could explain the speed change, I guess. But the only way to switch the direction of rotation is via a switch on the housing of the motor. And when you turn the speed down, it doesn't stop immediately. It slowly loses momentum. I can't explain the abrupt stop and change in direction. \nSo, that's my experience with the clinic ghost. \nA colleague of mine told me they had a similar experience in that room and the client witnessed it and stopped the session then and there. The client refused to stay in the room after the fan's shenanigans. I'm glad it had it's fun while my client was face down."" "

It may be possible that it helps to strengthen a person's case in seeking a restraining order when previously the court couldnt consider the dick picks because it wasn't illegal to send them. \nAny time someone shows a pattern of violating sexual consent, it indicates that they could escalate their behavior at any time. Flashers are more likely to escalate into harmful sexual assaults, which is one reason why it's good that it's possible to stop perpetrators at that stage. Dick picks are more removed physically, but they indicate a willingness to ignore consent and in a stalking/harrassment case take the violation into the sexual realm.
