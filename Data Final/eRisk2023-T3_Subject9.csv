Your blood supply then is not able to give these sacks the oxygen they need to grow, and your hairs will diffuse over time and fall out due to hypoxia.\n\nFinasteride tackles the problem by basically reducing total DHT by inhibiting the enzyme responsible for testosterone to DHT derivation in your body, therefore less thick hormone manifest gets in these sacks.\n\nMinoxidil tackles the problem of hypoxia specifically, basically forcing your body to work a bit harder to send more oxygen to the scalp.\n\nTo answer your question.

I mean at some point your warmups should just be longer, I'm not sure how old you are but I think around 30 people start to notice that they're more likely to face injuries. Additionally, everyone is different so try to acknowledge the injuries your body is more prone to and focus your warmup around that. For me if I don't do good rotator cuff warmup for example, I pretty much know I'm setting myself up for an injury. \n\nAlso judging by your history of lifting unconventional stuff, its possible your muscles are kind of formed around that. Many professional climbers and gymnasts for example have a lot of wrist problems that are chronic, and they need to acknowledge them and work around them in order to do what they do best.  \n\nI'd say focus on being consistent in the movement, maybe even switch to a very variation to address the problems and address them by completing the full rom at exactly the same speed. As in, you can probably identify where you're lacking by seeing what part of the exercise your body wants to do quicker since it is probably either due to muscle memory or an inconsistency in your fibers that you can work on to get a new baseline :). \n\nAgain, just a guess, and probably what I'd try from hearing your situation.""

Many initiation rituals like that are present in the first year, even after the general hazing period is over.The general hazing period usually consists of, memorizing and reciting songs and the history of the association. How well you recite it doesn't really matter all that much, its de-facto considered bad and can be punished in various ways, ranging from doing exercises, imitating animals, getting a random task that you will have to show later, etc. Its also common to have food thrown at you, and you won't be allowed to enjoy any alcohol at all as a result of rules determined by the universities.\n\nFinancially things differ between associations.-Members pay contribution to the association and/or often also to their dispute.-All the big associations have a contract with some beer company that allows them to offer extremely low prices for the beer, as long as they consume enough of it consistently.-Most associations have one building for the association (where they all get together and drink basically), and some will have seperate buildings for the disputes. These buildings are either owned by the disputes themselves or by the student association. Usually these buildings were bought long ago before the prices were as high as they are now. Some larger disputes apparently also have a beer contract as they are able to meet the quota on their own, so they have a tap in their house.  \n\n\nEmployment/work differs a bit across all of them. Associations like ''het corps'' tend to be able to afford their own employees to clean the buildings and pay bartenders, dj's etc. Other associations make their first years do some of the work, or have commissions with members do the work with some benefit in return (reduction of membership fee/ free drinks) etc, or do a combination of the above.""

The pb110 should have this fixed though as it also has bt5.\n\nThe boombox 2 is also ipx7 which makes it more durable when using it near a pool, and you dont have to worry about it in the rain.\n\nBattery life is also much longer on the bb2, i\xe2\x80\x99ve lost count how many hours ive been able to bring it on max volume. \n\nAlong with its more portable form, this is what made the bb2 more expensive than the partyboxes.\n\nSoundwise the bb2 will increase the bass eq up untill it reaches 80% volume, and then will increase the mids and highs from 80-100%. The reason they do this is because mids and highs travel better at outdoor use in comparison to bass. Though of course, quality wise it isnt the best, although you should consider the bb2 only is 60-80w, and the performance ratios for that power is pushed to reach that volume.\n\nImo the dsp and the soundstage of the partyboxes is better. Low eq reproduction is worse at lower volumes on the pb\xe2\x80\x99s but the high and overall balance is much better at higher party listening volumes. Now with dsp i mean that there is almost no delay in the aux in for the pb100\xe2\x80\x99s while there is for the bb2, though i must say that i tested this for the bb2 before they came with a software update improving the sound and aux features, so im not sure that this is still the case. Overall sound and sound balance imo is better on the pb100\xe2\x80\x99s' "

Zo vergroot het namelijk de kans dat het terecht komt bij een niet gevaccineerd persoon en zelf kan overleven.

This 84% primarily consists of younger groups, which makes sense because those are the groups that aren't completely vaccinated yet. Considering that the young population has less chance of hospitalization and long covid than their older counterparts it doesn't seem that problematic to me.\n\nI do think that lack of symptoms in vaccinated individuals can suggest that these are people that are less likely to go out of their way to get tested. Also because it is not neccesary for these groups due to the testing voor toegang policy. So the N for unvaccinated is far higher than the N for the vaccinated group, which can lead to sample problems and skewed representation.

Enige probleem hiermee is dat een PCR test niet actief virus kan meten, maar slechts aantoont of er genetische deeltjes van het virus aanwezig zijn in de neus/keel. Je zou dus ook met dode virusdeeltjes in je neus/keelholtes positief moeten testen via PCR. Dit is overigens ook de reden dat sommige landen (vooral zuid amerika nu vgm), je ook met antigeen tests laten reizen als je positief blijft testen op corona. \n\nHet logistieke probleem hier met gevaccineerden is dat aanwezige deeltjes niet per se betekenen dat de persoon ziek wordt, of uberhaubt andere mensen kan besmetten met deze deeltjes. Dit probleem versterkt zich met gevaccineerden, omdat we er vanuit gaan dat je immuunsysteem deze deeltjes in de meeste gevallen direct kan doden (dit bedoelde ik met ziekteverloop, alhoewel het miss niet echt ziekte te noemen is). De aanwezigheid van de deeltjes (positieve pcrtests) betekent dus langzaam steeds minder voor degene die gevaccineerd zijn. Het onderzoek hierin moet nog uitgebreid worden, maar je kan er wel degelijk vanuit gaan dat een positieve besmetting van een gevaccineerd individueel anders opweegt tegenover besmetting van een niet gevaccineerde. Het gevaar in de eerste instantie was overigens ziekenhuisopnames en niet besmetting; besmetting zal je namelijk altijd blijven zien. \n\nIn mijn eerste comment wou ik de suggestie doen om een variabele als ziekenhuisopnames mee te nemen, om te controleren op ratio gevaccineerden/niet gevaccineerden. Je moet namelijk 'iets' doen om deze PCRtesten nog enigzins te 'controleren'. Ik las wel een goed tegenargument, namelijk dat de IC cijfers 2 weken achterlopen. Daar ben ik het wel mee eens.

Just doesnt have the ipx 7 rating.\nBoth speakers have pairing options though JBL, as you may know, only lets you pair to the partyboost generation speakers.

Sometimes I will loop part of the first track when the second drop is about to come in and keep cutting that loop short, and perhaps applying a filter until that second drop hits.   \nAnother thing you can do is just go from drop to drop with the same EQ trick you might do for techno. When i'm playing house or for a club in general, I think its important to be able to switch tracks at any point.

I think I in depth know a lot about the conspiracies in this area and have researched them extensively.\n\nNevertheless my girlfriend convinced me to get the vaccine. Maybe this line of thinking will convince her that its not the worst thing in the world.\n\nAnecdotal experiences: You havent died and nor will you die anytime soon. You have a whole life ahead of you, why give up your freedom just to try and prove a point. Additionally I have put someone in a MRI machine yesterday the day of vaccination, if there were any metals or chips inside of her at the time of scanning; she honestly probably would have died right there and then, it seems that the vaccine is safe for most healthy people.

Agenda 21 for those who dont know is a conspiracy regarding massive population reduction in the 21st century. Rich depend on the poor to make money; big pharma would probably want ;to give us these yearly vaccines but wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to kill us with them because then there would be less taxpayers to make money off of.\n\nCovid skeptics generally did get their numbers wrong in NL: I participated in an AMA with a fvd party member, discussing the vaccination numbers in comparison to a heavy flu. He completely misread the method in which this information is published; the averages that are compares to COVID deaths are generalised over the past 5 years which include the other heavy flu seasons; for some reason fvd was adamant that this was only compared to a light season.\n\nSo yes; fear mongering for control is bad, the vaccine not neccesarily.'

I basically wanted the smaller size for portability, for sound I do think the Xtreme 3 is a better option, but of course that comes at a price. Its basically the difference between mono and stereo and driver setup. Xtreme has two woofers and two tweeters, and the charge 5 has one wide woofer and a tweeter.   \nThing is though that imo the speaker separation on small speakers isn't that noticeable. \n\nDon't consider getting the charge 4 over the 5, the 5 is definitely a good upgrade over the 4 in terms of travel (due to mid high focus its less energy costly to get sound to travel in comparison to low frequencies) and mids/high clarity.\n\n With the Xtreme you can definitely consider getting the 2 over the 3. Imo my main consideration is the connect+ generation ending as you mentioned in your title. We will have to wait and see if the next generation of JBL speakers will continue with Partyboost, and hope that they won't change to a new protocol again. \n\nWhen comparing Xtreme 2 to the charge 5 it really depends on what you prefer. In my opinion the mids and highs are more clear on the Charge 5 compared to the Xtreme 2, but then again, the Xtreme series has that stereo separation and an AC mode that the charge doesn't have. Another benefit to the Xtreme 2 is that it has an aux port. I think the bass performance on the Xtreme 2 is also better than on the Charge 5, mainly due to driver size. But then again you will also need to consider whether you prefer Partyboost over connect plus. \n\nThe only real difference between Partyboost and Connect+ is that Partyboost is more stable. When I pair my speakers I have no problem carrying them to other rooms for a multi-room setup with Partyboost (around 70m without walls and with source device close to main). Connect+ will cut off quite a bit quicker (35m)."" "

Once it has gotten easy, you move on to a heavier variation, and if you want to do proper step loading, you can have the transition week be a period of light exercise before you move onto heavier weight. If this is the goal, then you should aim for about 3 or 4 weeks of 5x5 and 1 week of rest, and then reset the week after with a heavier variation/load.  \nI'm not sure on your current level, but as a warning, I shall say that I do not recommend this for beginners. I am a firm believer in that beginners should first focus on acquiring basic foundational strength with enough volume (about 10 rep range) before moving on to specific strength training. Mainly because moving into strength rep range too early leaves you at very high risk for injury. I'm assuming that this is the reason why this program starts with this beginner routine, but I just want to stress the importance of having a good foundation first."" "

He explained that instead of counting from one hand to the next, and thus with 10 fingers in total and a 10 word counting system, these people counted from one pinkie from the next. They would start with the hands, go to the forearm, and go around the whole body until they ended up at the number 25 back at their other hand. This was a closed system, and these people never had the need to count to a higher number than that.  \nThese types of counting systems are more common in Papuan languages, there are even differences between men and women in some languages. The Yupna men for example, include the left testicle, the penis, and the right testicle in their number system, and if I remember correctly men can count higher than women in that language.  \nOver time however, it is predicted that more and more of these counting systems disappear.

Some individuals with bodybuilding aspirations might not fully lock out to alter development of their muscle bellies or for time under tension reasons, but for a pull up as a compound exercise I would argue that this is just dumb. An approach like that would maybe be useful for a bicep curl for example, or any isolatable exercise. I think most frequently though, the people who do this are just chasing reps, and therefore not fully extending to an elbow lockout in an active hang.\n\nThe benefit that you get from staying in an active hang vs dead hang is the time under tension; giving you hypertrophy benefits. Additionally the scapula is constantly engaged, and if constantly activated with chest pointing to bar will benefit transfer to front lever.\n\nThe benefit that you get from a dead hang position is that you are training scapula activation. For some calisthenics exercises, like the OAP this is very important.\n\nSo to conclude, both lock-out active hang or dead hang are good, just for different reasons. Don't under extend, that just seems stupid to me.  \n\n\nEDIT: Btw with L sit pull ups, I think active hang is generally better since your nervous system is working in the  'dead hang' anyways, so it isn't really 'dead', though I wanted to generalise my reply for pull ups in general.""

Your current approach is to gain weight relatively quickly, but obviously it takes time to build muscle along with that.  \nFocus on hitting 70-75kg first, and then go to 80. Make sure that of these calories you have around 120g of protein a day, and once you hit that 70-75mark go to 150g of protein. Once you do that, then see if you're gaining, and if thats a no, adjust your calorie intake to whatever is neccesary and most importantly to whatever is ''maintainable'' for you.   \nI wouldn't worry too much about eating ''too much'' in one meal, the research at this point seems to point out that that might even be healthier than snacking small amounts throughout the entire day. Most important thing is to eat ''more'' than you normally do and do that on a consistent basis and closely monitor what happens."" "
