Reform congregations and individuals can be just as devoted as Orthodox ones; the difference is a theological and philosophical one.\n\nReform is founded on the principle of fully integrating Judaism into modern life. Some people absolutely detest that idea, and they are entitled to believe that it's a bad idea but unfortunately they can spill over into disrespect towards people who believe differently. Reform believes that Halacha is an ever evolving, divine thing that should be constantly reconsidered in the light of new developments (such as scientific and technological advancements). Reform conversions require several years of study and community engagement just like any other denomination; that study and engagement looks different of course, because it looks Reform.\n\nOrthodoxy believes, to varying degrees, that Judaism should not be integrated into modern secular life. Modern Orthodox people are the most integrated of the orthodox groups; MO folks will likely wear denim, the women may or may not cover their hair or wear trousers, single gay men are likely to be somewhat accepted but not discussed openly. More traditional Orthodox women likely wont wear trousers, will cover their hair after marriage but probably wont shave it off, and gay folks would not be accepted. In Ultra Orthodox communities, women shave their heads and wear wigs or coverings. This is obviously an oversimplification but I wanted to give one or two things we could compare across Orthodox groups; there are many other differences as well. Conversion into Orthodoxy is generally a very long process, although it can be very fast in some circumstances such as for marriage.\n\nConservative or Masorti takes elements from both. They believe that Judaism can be a part of modern life, but that the texts themselves are not an evolving thing. While new interpretations are considered by Masorti authorities, they rest on linguistic, historical, and Halachic arguments (eg the argument that respecting trans people is a matter of pikuach nefesh; the argument that the prohibition against gay sex is a mistranslation/misunderstanding). Conversion to Masorti is usually several years of study."" "

Hormone levels vary wildly within each sex category and even more so for trans and intersex people. A trans man who has been on testosterone for a decade is going to have their thinking influenced by testosterone in a similar way to that of a cis, non-intersex man. A post-menopausal woman will have different hormone levels to a younger woman, and so on.\n\nBiological sex also gets very complicated for trans people; do you want to draw the line as sex assigned at birth, or current genitalia, or current hormone levels, or which hormone drove the individuals first puberty, or any other number of things.\n\nAs such, it\'s not a very informative metric on its own!

Halacha refers to the overall system of laws which is derived from the Torah and laid out in our scholarship, and it's a guide for how to live a Jewish life rather than just the laws themselves\n\nThere are 613 mitzvot (commandments), some of which are easy to keep and some are very difficult; some of them are also easy to understand as they're laid out in the Torah directly, whereas others are much harder to interpret and our understanding of them comes from centuries of scholarship. Most of us never have to think about it to conform with the mitzvah (commandment) of not committing bestiality, for instance, so it's not something you need to worry about it. Whereas not holding a grudge and loving all humans and sticking to all your promises is often very difficult, and requires a lot of attention\n\nCommandments like not worshipping other gods or false idols are very important and are reiterated throughout the Torah, whereas others are only mentioned once or are derived from passages where they're not explicitly stated. There are rabbinical doctrines which give us specific ways to avoid any *risk* of breaking an otherwise quite vague law; for example many orthodox couples will not share a bed while the wife is menstruating, even though it is not actually forbidden to share a bed during that time, but it is forbidden to be intimate during menstruation and for 7 days after. \n\nSo..... it's complicated!""

Some people try very hard to stick to the strictest interpretation of every one of the laws; others don\'t, either they have their own interpretations or they don\'t view all the laws as equally important or one law conflicts with another for them (eg if following a commandment would put their health at risk, they should not do it. So someone with a deadly allergy should carry an epipen on sabbath even though it\'s against one law to carry anything on sabbath, because there\'s a more important law which says to preserve your life and health)\n\nThere are lots of different interpretations of how some of the laws interact with the modern world, for example. What one person views as modest clothing might not be considered modest to someone else, much like how some Muslim women wear hijab and others wear niqab or burqa or none of the above\n\nThere\'s no expectation for non-Jews to follow Halacha either' "

Everyone at the club is different and we all have our own quirks, difficulties, things that come easy or hard to us.

Ask around with any local disabled people you know, or your rehab people might have suggestions too! In my city there's a group who meet for coffee twice a month, a disabled crafting group, a disability book and film club, and in my last city there were a group who went clubbing regularly too. And that's just groups of disabled people, there are so many more social things going on - book clubs, coffee meet-ups, film clubs, generic social groups\n\nIt feels weird to do socialising in such a structured way (to me at least) at first but you get used to it, and tbh abled adults have to do that too.""

I like the Virgil (Aeneid) and Ovid (Metamorphoses) ones in particular.

Virgil's Eclogues are good fun (one is Messianic, but we're still in pre-Christian Rome here so it's not Christian, and there's a huge amount of debate over who the child in question is supposed to be). \n\nCatullus is the obvious choice if you're interested in poetry; it's definitely harder, but I find it much more rewarding.

Everyone should do their Judaism in the best way for them, and we ask that all members respect that.\n2. **Centre trans voices**  \nWe\'re here to talk trans stuff and Jewish stuff; cis folks are welcome, but please be respectful of the space as a trans-focussed one. This includes asking for education; this is not a primarily educational space and people are not obliged to provide education, though they may choose to\n3. **No bigotry, discrimination, or prejudice of any kind**  \nI hope this goes without saying really, but prejudice or discrimination will not be tolerated here.\n4. **Keep it civil, respectful, and SFW**  \nIf you disagree with someone, please keep it respectful. We\'re a diverse group of people with a huge range of opinions; disagreeing is natural, but don\'t let it devolve into insults. If you\'re posting or commenting on images keep in mind that some Jews will keep tznius (modesty).\n5. **Spoiler and flair bad news, antisemitism, transphobia, etc**  \nWhile this is not a politics sub, we realise that being Jewish and being trans make our existence political; if you\'re discussing any of these things, please flair the post appropriately and ideally use the \'mark as spoiler\' option when you make the post (as this prevents body text being visible without clicking on the post; greying out text often doesn\'t work)' "

eRisk2023-T3_Subject32, b' ' , b'2022-07-13 19:46:23' , reddit post ," b'The average is a difficult question because each of the clinics has their own wait time, and patients also experience different wait times to the officially published ones. Officially, wait times vary from 12 months to 48 months for a first appointment; in reality, I\'ve had participants who\'ve been waiting over 6 years. One clinic in particular only sees about 10 new people each year, according to FOI requests, which would mean that if you were referred now and they kept seeing people at the same rate you wouldn\'t get seen for over a hundred years (off the top of my head the actual number is 1,000-something)\n\nThe reasons are multiple and complex. There are actually more qualified people available for these roles, but the gender identity service lacks the funding to hire them even if they wanted to. There are only a handful of gender identity clinics in the first place, dotted around the country. But, the whole NHS struggles with these things, and gender unfortunately comes under the mental health bracket which is especially underfunded.\n\nThere are also aspects of the approach which create delays; the NHS operates on what is known as the gatekeeper model, where every patient has to spend a long time within the service ""proving"" their gender, and only that service is allowed to count towards the time they spend in it. So for example you need at least 2 appointments before they\'ll refer you to the hormone service, who also have their own appointment requirements, with often 12-18 months between appointments. They want to get to know you and talk about your journey with gender and your transition goals to find what\'s gonna be best for you, which is all well and good... But if you\'ve already waited years to get there you\'ve very likely seen lots of therapists already, either within the NHS or privately, and they see you so infrequently that they\'re not getting to know you at all anyway. Eg you could see a private psychologist with an expertise in gender for years, but you still have to wait the same as everyone else and go over the same stuff, with an overworked clinician who had 5 minutes to glance over your file and probably doesn\'t remember the last time they saw you.\n\nAll of this is compounded by the issues facing MH services already, and the fact that even getting a referral to a GIC can be a long and arduous process (many GPs still insist on a lengthy psychological evaluation before they\'ll even process the referral, despite the GICs asking them not to).\n\nIt\'s just all a mess, and it leads to trans people being kinda left behind, unfortunately. \n\nEdit: Sorry that this is a bit of a wall of text, I\'m sure it\'s more than you were expecting but you really hit at a core problem with your question!'

The right of over half of the population to make healthcare decisions about their own body has already been taken away, there\'s no reason to think it can\'t be eroded even further.\n\nAlabama has already put forward legislation to try to forcibly detransition all trans people under 18 for example, directly referencing Dobbs as their justification. There are already reports of women being denied prescription medication they rely on because it can be used to overdose and force a miscarriage, there are already women trying to buy unsafe doses of OTC meds that are known to lead to possible miscarriage along with a huge host of extra side effects. The right to make decisions about marriage leans on the very same clause of the constitution that Dobbs attacked; neither same-sex marriage or interracial marriage have a ""long standing tradition"" within US law (which is what they argued abortion rights would need in order to stay protected- the right to interracial marriage is only 5 years older than RvW was). The right for disabled people to be free from institutional influences on their reproductive rights comes from the same clause; there are lots of people still living today who were forcibly sterilised by the US government because of a disability, and the protections against that are looking weaker now.\n\nSo yeah, even if you don\'t imminently need an abortion yourself, you should be very worried.'

Is there a correlating concept for disability? Not really.\n\nSo much more research is needed in this area and unfortunately it\'s just not being done. BID patients are a really hard population to study because they\'re often understandably untrusting, many want to keep their BID private, and the stigma is just huge.

I'm sure your rehab physios have got you doing lots of stuff, but feel free to tell them if there's something you want to focus on - a particular skill you want to work on, most of them require several composite skills.\n\nThere's no shame in needing help! Think about it like this: if this was someone in your life that you care about (partner, best friend, etc), would you think they had anything to be embarrassed about? Would you think them babyish for needing help? Of course not, so try not to direct that kind of criticism at yourself either [edit: this is where getting to know other disabled people really helped me actually. I have several friends who require help with things like eating, hygiene, etc and always will. Getting to know people in that situation that I once considered so terrible has shown me that it's really not - my friend with SMA is a biomedical researcher with tons of hobbies, sure she'll never live an independent life but she lives a wonderful one]\n\nWith your level of injury, you'll probably find transfers take a while to become fully independent, but you should get other skills faster. Dressing and undressing (from lying down) is something you can practice over and over again once any wounds are healed - stick some earbuds in and a good podcast or audiobook on, and just have at it for a while. You can start by using the rails on the hospital bed to help, then trying to use them less, etc. It took about a year before I was back to driving, and at that point I still needed help transferring to the car and someone else to put my chair away. But the actual driving with hand controls part came pretty easily for me thankfully, I actually find it more intuitive than driving with my feet was. After that it's just practice to build up the strength and technique for different transfers and such.\n\nHaving a properly fitted, custom active chair is also really important for independence, but you're really too early to be ordering a custom chair - things are gonna change a lot for you still, and a chair that's perfect for you now might be terrible in 6 months. If I were you I would have a look at the second hand market though if you can afford it, as you want to get into a decent chair and out of those shitty hospital tanks. Look for something adjustable - quickie argon is a great first chair for example"" "

Don't get me wrong I understand *why* he's angry, but he just gives in to anger and lets it rule his behaviour, which in real life would be totally unacceptable. You don't get to treat people poorly because you're angry, even if your anger is understandable, and the fact Fitz has bitterly experienced the consequences of this behaviour and yet continues to do it is what bothers me so much"" "

But Fitz fixates on every negative thing and refuses to acknowledge anything else (not just in terms of their differences, but including the things people have done for him, like reviving him), rather than disagreeing with people or managing his own anger he just resorts to insults. I can understand why, he's never been given the tools to do anything else, but it's the fact he recognises it in himself and then makes no effort that annoys me\n\nI also realise of course that conflict is what makes a story, and it would ultimately be a much less interesting book if people sat down to talk openly and respectfully about their differences"" "

But (a) most people *aren't* paying attention, and (b) those who are don't have the power to meaningfully stop him. It's also worth noting that we see Regal from Fitz's POV at all times, who he is absolutely awful towards, whereas we're given to understand that most of the other characters find him easily charming, albeit obnoxious. That goes a long way to explaining why most people aren't paying close attention to what he does.\n\nSecondly, Regal overlooks those he considers to be unimportant, those he thinks have little to no power, and those he can't charm. He puts a lot of effort into ensuring Shrewd is stripped of a large amount of his power, through his use of Wallace, exploiting his father's weakness for him, and so on. He doesn't put any effort into pulling the wool over Fitz's eyes, because he doesn't think Fitz is important. Kettricken is becoming more and more aware as time goes on, but again we see that Regal did expend effort at first to try to charm her, and when that doesn't work he switches tactics to instead try to reduce her power.\n\nWhat we're left with is the majority of people in the court, and in the wider keep community, not seeing what Regal is doing. The people who do see it - Fitz, Chade, the Fool - aren't in an overt position of power, which is why Regal ignores them. When things go badly for Regal it tends to be because he's overlooked people he thinks are unimportant, but he's not capable of learning from that, which is ultimately his major flaw - his own self importance means he can't improve on his previous schemes. So yes, he's petty and his motivations are incredibly shallow - but I don't think he's as incompetent as he seems."" "

I'm a full time student with a weekly workload of about 80-100 hours, my partner works from home full time. We live together with no extended support network. I've tried to organise care and a cleaner but all the agencies in my area are out of workers\n\nSo to the issue: they've been struggling with fatigue more than usual this year and I'm not sure how best to help them - neither are they sure what they need from me (obvs we've talked about this extensively before me coming to strangers on the Internet). They spend probably 3 days a week in bed largely unresponsive, thankfully their boss at work is sympathetic and lets them be flexible with their hours. On days when they are working they usually work maybe 3 hours a day on average, with several naps. Financially we can't afford for them to give up work\n\nThe thing that I struggle with most is that they don't really do things that they know help with their fatigue? Like they know it helps a lot if they exercise regularly but they haven't been to our wheelchair racing club for months, and they know that scheduling things on Sundays usually whacks them out for the whole week but they keep doing it anyway, etc. There's a lot of things like that. I've taken over all the household jobs that I'm physically capable of doing (eg I can't take the bins out cos the bin store is inaccessible), and I try to take care of them as best I can when they're struggling. But to be honest it's hard, I have finals and my own chronic illnesses to manage, and it's getting difficult for me to be sympathetic when I watch them knowingly make choices that make things worse. I'd never act anything but sympathetic to them of course and I do care a lot, but it's really wearing me down too.\n\nDoes anyone have any advice for how I can help?

Obvs none of us can give actual medical advice and the only people who can are your child's doctors. With the disclaimer stated, what are her symptoms like? Particularly on a daily basis, cos you've only mentioned the emergencies.\n\nThe fact you mentioned croup is interesting - the wheezing typical of asthma actually sounds quite different from other wheezing to those who are trained in what to look for (something I never got the hang of when I was studying medicine). There's rales, rhonchi, stridor, and wheezing, or at least those were the 4 most common types of abnormal sound we were always trying to distinguish between; it also matters whether the sound is on the inhale or the exhale or both, and how loud it is. So the fact that the drs have presumably listened to her breathing a number of times, hopefully both when she's not having an attack and when she is, is reassuring that they're likely on the right track, as the kind of sound can tell you a lot about what might be causing the issues.\n\nAnother important thing is simply whether the breathing difficulties respond to a rescue inhaler. Asthma causes the airways in the lungs to swell and construct, and then rescue inhalers cause them to open up again. If there's another kind of obstruction to breathing, the rescue inhaler won't do nearly as much (it usually still helps a bit to be fair, but if the airways are already open there's only so much you can achieve by telling them to open more). There are reasons asthmatics might not respond to specific rescue inhalers well, but it's a strong indicator of asthma if the breathing difficulties respond to one\n\nIt also takes a good while for any preventative treatment to start working, and most people need to spend a while adjusting dosages or trying different things, so don't be disheartened by that. Just make sure to keep on top of it! Inhaler technique is also really important if you have any inhaled medicine, you should be using a spacer, ideally one with a mask that covers her nose as well as her mouth. I'm sure they've covered it but don't hesitate to ask for help from your drs on inhaler and spacer technique or just reassurance that you and your child are doing it right"" "

Seems pretty reasonable that the enemy would try to sneak up on the meditating PC and neutralise them to then go about his stealing, and he succeeded on the contest and the hit\n\nEdit: I should also say I warned them when they chose to do this that they\'d be missing out on this arc if they just sat away from everyone doing nothing, and gave them several opportunities to come join in.

It\'s better to do the things you can than to burn yourself out trying to do everything all at once.

We have a truly giant ginger tom, adopted last summer. He's about 8kg and bigger than a small dog. I'm desperately trying to find an automatic or semi automatic litter tray that's actually big enough for him to use, at this point I don't care how much it costs or where I have to buy it from\n\nHe digs in the litter a LOT. I'm talking for a solid 5 minutes after he poops, he will dig like there's solid gold at the bottom of his litter tray. This means he breaks up the clumps of even the hardiest litters, and sprays litter everywhere. And once it's on the floor, it gets all over the house. I wouldn't mind so much if it was clean litter, but it's usually small clumps of poop.\n\nWe just got rid of [this one](https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/woof-n-meow-the-smart-semi-auto-litter-box/x/17879750#/) because the hole in the front was so big and uncovered that he just shot litter out of it like a catapult.

My partner works and they're paid monthly. We're also on universal credit (because I have LCWRA we're allowed to stay on UC even though I'm a student), but due to my student income we only receive UC for 4 months per year during the summer holidays. We want to create a budget that shows our joint spending as well as individual spending, but if that's not possible we're also happy to make separate individual budgets and just include a % of our joint spending on each (it's not quite 50:50 cos they earn more than I get from my loans). We use monzo for our joint account, and my individual account is monzo too, so the in-built budget tools are helpful but they really don't handle the income weirdness well!\n\nI've yet to find a CHEAP budget tool that can handle the mix of regular income and irregular income, but it's essential that I'm able to account for my student loans within my budget. Otherwise it looks like I have only my PIP as monthly income, and the budget is always thrown off.\n\nETA: splitting my loans up by month doesn't work either, because it doesn't account for the summer and it also means the budget doesn't reflect what I actually have. Eg, if I put into a spreadsheet that I get [loan amount / 3] every month, AND that I currently have the full loan amount in my bank account, it gives me way too much spending money and I end up overspending. That's the issue I've been having so far and it's why I'm looking for a new tool - getting a big wad of cash three times a year is very unhelpful for budgeting\n\nThanks in advance!"" "

Ignore the ginseng on death's door, i picked it up from ikea yesterday in the hopes i can nurse it back to life!\n\nthe second pic is four plants that've outgrown the main shelves (feat. lego bonsai), and really aren't getting enough light where they are. at the moment i rotate around which 2 get to be on the shelves - currently the spider plant and zz plant, in a few weeks i'll swap them around. But the aloe is too heavy regardless, and burns in my one window of full light. That's about as bright as the natural light gets in this window, which is directly to the left."" "

I would rather have a stroke tomorrow than detransition.\n\nI have a gp appointment tomorrow but she said she\'d need urgent advice from the GIC because she\'s ""less inclined to mess with that on her own"" (she stopped my ADHD meds).
