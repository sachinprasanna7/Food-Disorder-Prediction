eRisk2022-T3_Subject22,, 2021-11-17 17:11:24 , reddit post ," veganism does help w the hunger problem bc animal agriculture takes up so much more land for so much less food and although working conditions are bad almost everywhere, being exploited for your labor in a meat plant also comes with constant trauma from witnessing and participating in animal cruelty.

i totally understand what you mean, and i guess where i get tripped up is when i think about how many other major problems animal agriculture contributes to and how most ppl i know could be vegan and aren’t. veganism helps to address so much inequity that occurs as a result of climate change, labor conditions, and proximity to toxins and pollutants.

i also think the flip side of this is that we as vegans need to remember that being vegan doesn’t excuse us from participating in other activism and taking active steps to combat those other problems you mentioned. and boycotting and donating does help! a lot of veganism is essentially boycotting companies that profit off of animal exploitation.

sorry, this is kind of word vomit, but i do hear where you’re coming from and agree that we gotta remember that animal liberation isn’t the *only* important cause. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject22,, 2021-11-15 04:24:42 , reddit post ," no i’ve thought about this too! asking for reassurance and just any reassurance seeking behavior is a symptom of ocd that ur supposed to combat by not giving that reassurance. it’s only temporary and usually ppl w ocd (in my personal and secondhand experience) aren’t really going to believe the reassurance. or at least it’ll only provide relief for a moment. so yeah i totally agree that giving that reassurance can be harmful. if it’s someone asking because they’re considering treatment, that’s a different story in my opinion. but i feel like some of these “is my ed real/bad enough” questions should maybe be answered with “why is that important to you? suffering is suffering and it doesn’t matter who has it worse than you, you deserve care and help and love” eating disorders especially tend to fixate on “am i sick enough? is this real? is this valid?” and it’s such a bullshit question because if your life is worse because of your disordered eating, you are sick enough! this mindset keeps ppl trapped for longer thinking they have to be “sick enough” to get help. ahh this is also word vomit but ya know…

anyway tl;dr: everyone is sick enough to get help and i worry that reassuring ppl with compulsive reassurance-seeking behaviors will only give them relief short term and exacerbate the problem in the long run. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject22,, 2021-10-19 04:38:42 , reddit post ," sorry, no one deserves to be misgendered. i hope this doesn’t put you off of rejecting animal cruelty though! ppl can be abrasive but at the end of the day it’s about the animals.

vegetarianism still contributes to animal cruelty in a very significant way. i think a lot of vegans get frustrated with vegetarians for claiming to be pro-animal rights while actively participating in their abuse and murder, and vegan meme spaces (and other vegan spaces) can be a good place for us to vent about our collective frustration and sadness and find humor in something very discouraging. lots of us don’t have vegan friends irl to talk to and it’s fun to joke around with other internet vegans :) if you find yourself getting offended by these jokes to the point that you prioritize pride and spite over animal welfare, maybe don’t hang around on those pages. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject22,, 2021-10-19 04:26:11 , reddit post ," i think maybe the point is to just face the anxiety and eat the food anyway until your brain doesn’t see it as a threat anymore. i totally get this approach, but i also didn’t find it worked for me (partly because bingeing was already part of my disorder and i couldn’t keep myself from purging still). what you should maybe consider is whether you’re medically stable enough to exercise and if you *can* exercise in moderation without compulsion taking over. same with food monitoring.

i started seeing a dietician (thanks emily program) who helped me monitor my intake in a much more relaxed, holistic way to make sure i was eating enough and regularly, and helped me re-introduce fear foods in moderation instead of bingeing. i have unfortunately undone all her hard work but i would say in my VERY unprofessional opinion that finding a dietician you’re comfortable with and whose approach suits you is just as important as a therapist. you put a LOT of trust into your dietician, and if you don’t feel like you can trust them or if their approach is making you feel worse, i think it’s worth discussing w them or even finding a different dietician. maybe ask her for the reasoning behind her methods? see if they make sense to you?

the one caveat here is to make sure you’re not just switching to a dietician/approach your eating disorder is more happy with, but finding one who makes *you* as a whole person feel more fulfilled and nourished. every person is different, and while the “completely unrestricted eating” strategy works for some, it doesn’t for all of us. as someone who relies heavily on exercise for my mental health and sleep, it just wasn’t something i could cut out without my quality of life declining significantly. luckily i was medically stable enough to do this!

i hope this maybe helped somewhat!! take it with a grain of salt, as it’s coming from one disordered person to another. and if eating foods with less nutritional value is helping you heal, that’s perfectly okay too!! they’re not morally worse and you shouldn’t feel guilty for eating them. good luck! sending hugs❤️ "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject22,, 2021-09-14 23:07:55 , reddit post ," My one thought is that grocery stores with healthy vegan options and are far more predominant in white neighborhoods (food deserts skew toward meat-heavy fast food). However, I don’t think that makes your point of view uniquely privileged, especially as a low-income vegan. I also want to underscore the BBC article that @gladstonebrookes linked because I think that info is so important for people to hear!! Especially outside of the vegan community, there’s an assumption that it’s a predominantly white movement, which undermines the amazing efforts of non-white (especially black) vegan activists. What’s fascinating to me is how white non-vegans justify not being vegan by claiming it’s something that exposes your white privilege. If you have the privilege to be vegan easier, isn’t that all the more reason to do it?? The environmental impacts of animal agriculture disproportionately affect black and brown communities, as well as exploited countries in the global south. Shouldn’t you do your part as a privileged person to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis?? It’s also worth pointing out that most other countries have more vegan and vegetarian dishes than American cuisine!! I’ve found myself making more and more South American, Indian, and middle eastern foods since going vegan. "

Then I was doing seasonal work and had to eat whatever the cooks made for us. The first one, it was almost impossible just to be vegetarian. They provided no veggie options other than salads or deep fried foods. At the second one, I cut out dairy but still ate eggs. And then I realized I was just ignoring my own morals and animal rights just bc I felt like it was “good enough” to just be vegetarian. I also have had an eating disorder for like four/five years (mostly bn) so everyone told me “you can’t go vegan that’s just an excuse to restrict” but like,, at least this way the cruelty in my diet is what I inflict on myself lmao.

It sounds like purging is already pretty compulsive for you, so I would suggest seeing a therapist first and foremost. They can help you figure out better coping skills and identify the emotions that lead to purging. You can also try to figure out some by yourself. Journaling has been super helpful for me to recognize patterns in my emotions and behaviors. If that sounds productive for you, maybe try it out?
I wish that I had reached out for help far earlier and told people what I was going through. It got out of hand quickly and now is a chronic issue that might never go away. Early support is key! Don’t try to do it alone❤️
Also write down things that motivate you to be healthy, things you’re looking forward to, etc and put them where you’ll see them when you’re having a hard time. Staying motivated to break bad habits can be really hard but you got this!! "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject22,, 2021-07-25 00:08:23 , reddit post ," I never gained weight from my SSRI’s and I’ve been on a few on high doses :) I think the way it contributes to ppl gaining weight is by improving appetite as depression symptoms improve, but everyone’s chemistry is different. Just keep in close contact with your prescribing doctor about side effects. "

I don’t have any answers... just commenting cause ur not alone and I’m also interested in what’s helped other ppl with this side effect. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject22,, 2021-05-30 23:43:07 , reddit post ," Some of the most helpful things to offer:
-Help her make a grocery list/ plan meals (I lost the concept of “normal meals” and needed guidance from someone without an ed to tell me if I was eating healthy portions and variety)
-Go to the grocery store with her (it’s stressful grocery shopping with an ed and easy to get obsessive and anxious over food choices)
-Black out the nutrition info on food packages (she can still look it up, but that at least takes an extra step and leaves her more able to fight the urge to count calories)
-Eat with her (you have to be eating too though)
-Stay with her after meals (ideally, go somewhere where she can’t purge, like on a walk or drive, so it’s just not an option. Or just help distract her from the horrible thoughts and purging urges) "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject22,, 2021-05-30 23:10:21 , reddit post ," That sounds like it could harm her body a lot if it hasn’t already. Can you help her see a doctor/counselor/therapist? There are some free services available. medical independence age varies by state, but look it up to see what medical information she can keep private from her mom. Or see if you can eat with her? And keep her distracted after meals? I would have done anything to have a friend “babysit” me during/after meals to help me fight the urges, but was too afraid to ask. I think the most you can do is just keep offering your help and support and try not to let her ignore it. If she’s not ready for help and she’s medically stable, that’s all you can really do. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject22,, 2020-11-12 16:48:17 , reddit post ," Getting support from someone is crucial. It doesn’t have to be a doctor, though, if ur not okay with that. Can you tell a friend or family member who can support you? Also eating regularly is so important!! Try to eat three meals and three snacks a day, even if they’re small. I had to work toward that goal for a really long time, but it does help. And be kind to yourself when you inevitably mess up :) "
