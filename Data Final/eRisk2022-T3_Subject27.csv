So Orthodox Jews kind of believe in heaven and hell. So to start, there are numerous explanations of what exactly heaven and hell is in Judaism (Of course Jews can never agree). Generally though, heaven is a realm completely separate from everything physical, that means no pleasure and the like. And Orthodox Jews don't believe in hell. Instead, ""evil"" souls either are destroyed, or goes to Gehenom, a sort of pergatory that ""cleanses"" the soul before it goes to heaven.

It entirely depends on the Christian and what you mean by salvation.

In Judaism there's a concept of a Noahide. These people in a sense believe in Judaism, but don't need to be Jews. They have 7 laws in the Torah, pretty basic ones like, don't kill, don't steal, and are generally expected to be good people. Many people, according to Jews, just don't need to be Jews and can live perfect lives not being Jewish. "

Are you claiming immortality?

>Yikes

You're telling me that the fact that humans aren't immortal is a bad thing? There's countless amounts of literature refuting that.

I can answer your small arguments that say, ""how could God have done this, isn't this evil!?"" individually, But generally speaking, if you read it plainly I guess maybe one might accidentally see it as evil for all people's standards, but its not really. Like the rapist one, I've always read it as, ""the rapist has an obligation to marry his victim and the victim has no obligation, especially if their father doesn't let them"", that's just an example of a possible reading.

Also, look at the time period. As per those people, it was entirely considered moral to do what the Israelites did and then when you take in the ""God is omnibenevolent"" it only makes sense that the Israelites felt that had to. But you cannot claim that you know the reason for the wars. If was not explicitly said to be to ethnically cleanse those people, then who are you to say, ""well it makes sense if that's the case and I like it"".
It appears to me your argument is based on the assumption that they did it for ethnic cleansing, end of story. From the perspective of a believer of the texts authenticity, why would your view on what happened necessarily be true. It just seems like an assumption and then this argument that, ""God says to do evil things"" is a claim based on an assumption, mine is too, dont get me wrong, but then I dont see how your claim is more correct that mine.

If you were to say that the historians say this is the case I'd respond that I dont think it has a place in this  conversation since my argument is based on the assumption of the authenticity of the texts which is doubted by historians.

Could we just end this here. I dont wish to continue this. Just to be clear I didn't give up because of your points, its just that I see that we are (neither of our faults) going into circles and I didn't want to debate anyways. Maybe this is not a thing two lads can properly solve by sending lengthy replies to each other on reddit.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject27,, 2020-09-16 18:30:23 , reddit post ," I'm not claiming anyone was killed because they were evil and deserving of death penalty, simply that people can be killed and its not necessarily bad. And its assumed that if we did know why, we would agree with his behavior, that's the belief.
Thus from this you can only agree with his behavior.

Yes, it's strongly relied on the fact that god is omnibenevolent but I think its more relied on the fact that we don't know everything.

God is all powerful and god is all good and evil exists  therfore God is either not all powerful or not all good. This is just not necessarily true (I say this because it sounds like you were going towards this in your last paragraph)

And even though he gave up on the argument of yours that not every killed person could have been evil, i find that odd because I think he was claiming something else entirely. He was saying there are reasons people die, Jesus died for one reason, everyone will die for one reason, soldiers die for one reason, sick babies die for one reason, etc. And since you dont necessarily always know the reason, you cant say it's evil.
Everyone on earth will be killed by god in one way or another and this mass genocide of humanity isn't bad so why should we be so quick to say its bad when we look at these wars?
You are relying on the fact that we do in fact know why the wars were waged and why they were commanded this,  which is simply not true.

""Should you believe something that has a lot of ambiguity?"" is a different argument btw. I dont want to delve into should you believe in god.

Does god see killing non believers as a good thing? As per most people of these beliefs, I doubt it. I think they they don't believe god would do this because simply killing someone only because they are non believers causes more harm than good (which doesn't necessarily apply to this caGod.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject27,, 2020-09-16 03:00:10 , reddit post ," >I'll be honest, that is absolutely terrifying...
I mightve made a mistake in explaining myself. I believe in the most general sense that killing babies is bad. There are many others who agree with that.

So it appears youre arguing multiple things. One is that killing many people is always wrong and two that god would've fixed the situation himself and since he didn't the war must've been tribal warfare.
Correct me if I'm wrong about the above because my answer will be based on this.

I don't see an issue with  saying that in very few situations you're allowed to kill people, even babies especially if you were told this by god who's established to be good and all knowing or whatever, assuming one exists. (Sometimes we too are allowed to kill people btw according to the law)

Whats different from hitler is that hitler usually isn't regarded as being omniscient but the god in Samuel is. And that's an important distinction to make. God being omniscient means he knows every possible outcome of every action and thus is trustworthy when it comes to is x good or is x bad. We on the other hand are not all knowing and don't have that kind of say sometimes. Sure, murder sounds terrible, murder of an innocent sounds even worse, but the belief is that innocent people can die when the outcome is significantly better than if they didn't.
Take Jesus for example,  the innocent lamb who was killed. This was a bad thing that was actually good because it benefits people better than if he hadn't, as per the belief. I imagine the same or atleast a similar principle can be applied to the book of Samuel.

So I don't think there's reason to assume god didn't deal with the issue. The way he deals with the issue is by commanding the people. Anyways, to go from god didn't do it himself to therefore its tribal warfare is not an argument I'm exactly understanding.

And regarding whether he was really answering thelegitductape, I think we'll have to agree to disagree on that one. When I was reading it I saw how it applied to real life and the story and I don't wish to explain each of his points because it'll be annoying trying to study his intentions.

To be clear, this isn't divine command theory. I'm not explaining the argument that states that its good because god willed it. The argument is that it is good whether or not you know why and god commanded this good thing. It's a bit different but I still get your point. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject27,, 2020-09-16 01:21:25 , reddit post ," >Are you actually sure about that?

I'm not the one claiming it, im just trying to explain the other dudes opinion which is based on this long lasting tradition on the view of God whether true or false.


>Because in the context of the story, it was just tribal warfare, which is historically accurate.

So the thing is that people who follow these books don't always believe these wars are only tribal warfare. They commonly say that these were wars commanded by god in order to do something eternally good (whatever that means), not just petty fighting of two tribes being like, ""I don't like your god"".
It comes back to the first premise. The assumption is that we can't  be certain regarding the entire situation and thus we can't make claims such as that the babies were killed solely because they followed a different religion (To be clear, I'm not saying this is true, I'm saying this is one of their justifications for their belief) rather there's other possibilities which is what thatoneguy was trying to say.

>To kill a baby just because it was being raised in a religion that didn't worship a god it didn't even know to exist?

I personally agree with this and I'm sure many followers of these texts believes this statement too. But there is a question whether this statement actually applies back to the text in the book of Samuel.

>but thatoneguy never really actually answered his questions

It looked to me that he did indeed answer the question. He was saying that in the context of killing a baby, morality is more complex than ""it is a fundamentally evil thing"". His hypothetical was his effort to show this, that even though something is normally bad, sometimes it can be the best thing to do.
I felt that the other dude was just glossing over this,  and trying to get him to say, ""I think killing babies is okay"" which in only a specific case he agrees with, but usually he doesn't. This seemed more like a tactic to make him look dumb instead of trying to actually discuss things.


I do have to mention the fact that the idea that god is always good and if he does something bad, it must actually be good in disguise is indeed a huge leap of faith. Wouldn't it be easier to just say that therefore god isn't good? But religious people will tend to say, ""when I say god is good, I dont mean we perceive every action of his as good, rather I mean that IF you were to see what he sees, you'd agree that its good (no one sees what God sees). You can call it mental gymnastics, but I'll just call it one of the views of god, and just because its justification isn't simple, I wouldn't disregard it.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject27,, 2020-09-15 23:33:24 , reddit post ," I don't really want to start a debate because I don't necessarily agree with either of the two lads. Just wanted to say that.

So from my outside perspective, it appeared thatoneguy was making an argument based on two premises. 1 we don't know everything and 2 God is omnibenevolent therefore if God were to command to kill babies it would somehow actually not be a bad  thing and to say that it is in fact bad would break the first premise. Now the reason this is strange and disturbing is as I think  thatoneguy said that its such a rare event that in almost all cases it is a disgusting act, but there are times when disgusting acts are the best thing we can do and that ""best thing"" is called a good thing.

The other dude (atleast how it looked to me) just kept repeating that killing babies is bad therefore if you command to kill babies you are bad too which in my opinion is too simple of a representation of what makes things good and bad.

I'm not advocating for the fact that killing babies is good or even sometimes good, I'm just saying (here's the part that really explains my comment) that thatoneguy seemed to be actually trying to answer the questions instead of constantly asking the same question and trying to find truth.

Women are indeed many times discriminated against but they play a role just as important as the men. A jew with a purpose to help others.

Very much so. There's the belief that God will always be there and that justice takes place, but also I feel that I'm in a wonderful, accepting community which also gives me confidence.

The common proof is from Lo Tasur (Dev. 17:11) but The Ramban argues this and says that it only applies to when the rabbi is judging a case, as that is the context of the passuk.

So, what then would obligate us in keeping the mitzvot Derabanan?

And to take it a step further, who gave permission to the rabbis to say that Hashem made a commandment (Ex: Netilat Yedaim) when He in reality never did? We say Hashem commanded us in that mitzvah (even though He didnt) when we say the Bracha, and that seems to go against Bal Tosif. "

If you need specifically blast protection more than others because you are an unlucky lad (like me), you can swap out normal protection for blast protection on a different armor piece and become extra protected. "

The formula for how much damage is absorbed with the protection enchantment is (4*Level)%

The formula for fire protection  is (15*level)%.

So while the protection enchant is for all damage types, it's not as strong as the other, specific, protection enchants. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject27,, 2019-07-29 18:34:37 , reddit post , Wow... I'm just impressed at this mad man. 
eRisk2022-T3_Subject27,, 2019-07-28 04:19:19 , reddit post ," Well what separates my belief from the ""Mormon Belief"" is that that I believe 1) God is not corporeal as others commenters have said in this thread and also that 2) God has no defined place, He is not ""elsewhere"" as one person said or even in ""outer-space"" as another said. He is everywhere yet doesn't need space to be. 3) Lastly, There has only been one of He. He's indivisible and everlasting. There isnt an idea of man attaining the status of God in my belief.

Those differences, to me atleast, are huge. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject27,, 2019-07-27 01:06:56 , reddit post ," An interesting note the add:
The Dogon tribe in Mali, West Africa have a cool relationship with the star Sirius.
 They're ancient teachings say that there were a group of beings, which they called the Nommo, who lived on a planet called, ""Nyan Tolo"" which orbits the star, Sirus C (hasn't been found). The Nommo people were said to have taught the Dogon people about the star, Sirius B (does exist) which isn't visible to the naked eye nor photographed until 1970. They also taught many other true facts such as heliocentrism before it was even proven.

The correlation between the Mormon teachings and the Dogon teaching are surprising, we already to me. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject27,, 2019-07-27 00:33:47 , reddit post ," Some say the star/planet is the star Regulus, due to the fact that Kolob might've originated from the word Qalb - Lion (Arabic), which refers to the star Qalb-alasad in Arabic and Regulus in English.

Others propose that it could refer to the star Sirius due to the fact that Kolob might've originated from the word Kalb - Dog(Hebrew - Older pronounciation) which refers to Sirius the dog star.

There probably are other explanations but this are the two I've known of. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject27,, 2019-07-26 17:39:51 , reddit post ," Well to begin, I don't believe God and His angels are living nor dead, that's a rule that only applies to his physical creations like us. I also believe that He doesn't take space nor does He have a location.

Regarding angels however I belief there are different planes/dimensions intertwined with each other and the angels can be in whatever location they were told to be whether it be on Earth or in outerspace, but since they don't live and die they aren't life and thus aren't aliens. To me at least, so, where do you say They are? "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject27,, 2019-07-26 17:24:06 , reddit post ," So your belief is that God and His angels live elsewhere, but not elsewhere as in outer space, right? So where do you say He is. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject27,, 2019-07-26 16:42:37 , reddit post ," Well, there's an idea in Mormonism around the fact that there are aliens on planets (and stars too) all around us, some of whom have come to deliver messages sent by God(s) who resides there too. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject27,, 2019-06-19 20:33:35 , reddit post ," Ah, you're make a really good point. A company should be forced to suffer in their beliefs (non-religous) so that others don't have to be forced to actually suffer due to unchangeable factors.

It's better this way, we then get more qualified people in the workforce and we'll be helping the country whether some bigot likes it or not.

However, I have found there to be one slight problem. I've heard from people I know that they had to hire a woman over an even more qualified man because they fear that they'll be in trouble for not having ""enough women* and they'll look bigoted.
The truth is, that's not an excuse to make it legal, but it's just an example of how we are all hurt, just who is more. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject27,, 2019-06-19 19:50:58 , reddit post , Well the employers aren't killing women are they? They are just hurting their own business. 
eRisk2022-T3_Subject27,, 2019-06-19 19:00:50 , reddit post ," True, it can't be guaranteed, but there's a good chance that if you're qualified you'll find somewhere or heck, start something that will be more successful than those who chose not to hire you.

It is surely biased, but should they get into loads of trouble for it? The women feel more comfortable without the qualified man. Maybe their business will fail maybe it wont. So their shouldn't be government intervention. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject27,, 2019-06-19 18:43:32 , reddit post ," There will always be a business willing to hire a qualified woman.

The postman clearly has proven himself to be unintelligent, or is he just faking it? Does he come from the twilight realm?
Or, the unlikely possibility, he follows you.
