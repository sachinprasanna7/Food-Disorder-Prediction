The last time we talled about it he told me he wants a kid in the future but few weeks ago I saw a really pregnant woman and I got scared, the size of that belly freaked me out and I don't know of I will ever want that. Maybe my mind changes but for now, all I know is that I rather adopt than birth. Also, nowadays I feel like bringing a new life to this doomed wold is such a selfish thing. "
