Our auditioning med students see 2-3 patients at a time, and the resident helps offload some of the work so the students can spend more time in the room and seeing interesting stuff. \n\nIn the same way that you expect your team to do their part of the list, we expect everyone in the ED will be pushing themselves to carry their weight. The difference is when we\xe2\x80\x99re inpatient, we get assigned half the list, whereas in the ED the expectation is that you\xe2\x80\x99ll be self-governing.

Asymptomatic HTN should almost never be managed from the ED but every primary sends me a few patients a week, either from the office or sent in from home, for a systolic of 180.

Once they are in the ED it is much harder to de-escalate. My assumption is that this is how some PCPs foster a \xe2\x80\x9ctherapeutic\xe2\x80\x9d relationship with the patient; you\xe2\x80\x99re the \xe2\x80\x9cnice one\xe2\x80\x9d who always sends them in and I\xe2\x80\x99m the mean one who won\xe2\x80\x99t order their stat whole-body MRI.'

You also have the benefit of having extremely even footfalls, which has pros and cons. Finally, you probably have the benefit of AC and water which in Arizona is a major thing.\n\nA few thoughts: you will likely be slower outside than your are on a treadmill. You should start in the early morning or evening to avoid the peak sun. You should plan short runs initially until you figure out how to comfortably go a few miles without water in a dry, hot environment. Also plan to run in areas you're familiar with to start. You may eventually need different shoes, as your local terrain may be harder on your joints (and on your shoes) than a treadmill. Be safe! Have fun!"" "

When there are many confounding factors (age/race/SES/etc) it is difficult to say anything particularly conclusive without very careful study. \n\nYou may want to more narrowly define the area of focus. ""Women"" is a large, diverse group and ""women diagnosed with SSD"" by comparison is an extremely small, likely much more homogenous group, so your point would be strengthened by drawing a clearer connection from ""women"" -> women are historically undertreated/understudied/""just stressed"" diagnoses -> SSD diagnosis. Clearly, not all undertreated women end up with a diagnosis of SSD, so you need to account for that difference if you want your issue with the diagnosis itself to be taken seriously. \n\nAs a final point, I now have one (1) year as a doctor and I feel comfortable saying some people absolutely have a psychiatric disorder relating to their health, and most of them are adamant that psychiatric treatment won\'t help them.

It\xe2\x80\x99s not a huge deal but if you\xe2\x80\x99re doing most of your training on a treadmill you shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t expect your treadmill pace to correspond to your road pace.' "
