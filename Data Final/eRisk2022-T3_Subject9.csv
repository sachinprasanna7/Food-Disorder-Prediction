eRisk2022-T3_Subject9,, 2021-11-07 06:42:28 , reddit post ," I've struggled with eating healthy, almost all my life and this is what I did:

1. Find my joy - I like moving my body but can't gym for a variety of reason. But I love walking, so I walk :) keeping me upbeat about it, I pair a podcast to the length of my walk and that's my ME time :)



2. Understanding Food - at a low point, I just couldn't understand why I wanted a burger when a salad would fill me up. Read up on cravings, sugar addiction and basically understood how these things were making me crave junk food.



3. Milestones - I have a milestones where if I eat clean for a set number of days then I could eat off a list I had already prepared.



4. As my quantity of clean healthy food and walks went up on an average, I felt the difference - I didn't enjoy how I felt AFTER I ate that meal (off my list). I think it (the craving for junk foods) kinda tapered off.



5. Always told myself nothing is off limits but some food I can eat all the time, some foods sometimes :)



As I went through my phases of burger maniac to takeout queen to currently fat vegan : these rules have genuinely helped stabilise my relationship with food.



Give yourself time and patience, if something is not working - see which component is not working (for me a mustard vineger dressing changed how I saw green beans) and hack it.

I always make him wear a comfortable muzzle and chest harness and I feel these measures have kept everyone safe including my dog.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject9,, 2021-10-29 09:04:03 , reddit post ," I googled when I was in college and some names of groups came up. Then I ran those names through my seniors and literally this 1 other lesbian who was 'out' in my year in our college.

Then I met up for a vetting process and became a volunteer for that group which was for LBT women. That opened the queer world for me and I met a lot of people. Then we organised Pride 😊 which obviously led to meeting a host of new people whi are now friends.

Plus obviously friends of friends etc and then there used to be Pegs and Pints - our whole and sole pub 😂😂😂😂😂 although I was too broke to go there for drinks, most of the time. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject9,, 2021-10-28 21:06:17 , reddit post ," Well, I can honestly only talk about Delhi and Bombay. Plus I'm not Trans so mileage may vary. My friends who identify as Trans have told me that things - administratively and socially are on the mend. But then again, it's restrictive to certain areas and aspects. Some have continued to have problems with renting places and jobs.

The younger generation is much more inclusive as well as informed and that's so beneficial for a whole bunch of people and I think that's great again.

One thing I have seen again and again that at times what can be seen as blatant homophobia is ignorance and given a chance things people are willing to make small adjustments (just my view).

Eg: An old landlord of mine must have realised a few months into my tenancy that I ain't straight (giant pride flag might have given it away😂). He came across as brusque in our interactions but since I paid my rent on time, he had no cause to complain. After 2yrs when I was shifting out, he said - I thought I didn't like people like you but now that I've met you, I would be happy to rent to others. Ain't no big victory for lgbt rights but 3 years later, a gay couple that I know are still happily renting that flat in Dwarka 😊 "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject9,, 2021-09-16 10:51:28 , reddit post ," >**TLDR** - I was surprised by how little food adds up to so many calories when it looks like little food.

Absolutely. I'm remember laughing almost hysterically the first time I counted my calories and realised how calories rich junk food was!

my pack of chips was almost the same (512 calories) if not more that 1 serving of Dal (lentils), 1 serving of green veggies and 2 Rotis (small Indian flat bread prepared from whole grain flour).  Plus I get hungry quicker if I have just chips.

So essentially I was spending more money to eat junk food that made me hungrier, quicker so I would spend more money on food 💸😢



>My question to you kind folks: What the hell do you eat to stay healthy?? I need ideas an inspiration for easy to make foods when you have little time.

My tips:

1. Sit and understand Protein, Fat, Carbs and Fiber.

You'll spend a little time upfront but man oh man does it help in the long run to understand what's working for you and how to hack your eating habits.


2. Eat as close to original as possible (Buy whole Foods). The more processed the food, the more it will (90% of the time in India) be calorie rich and odd portions. I buy veggies, lentils, fruits etc. Once a week after I plan what I am cooking thereby reducing wastage, its cheaper and I am not stressed wach day as to what am I cooking.


3. Try different cuisines - while some recipes are universal, I feel most of us have a cuisine that we grew up with and it's close to our hearts and mouth. For my partner it's a burger - she can survive on just 1 good burger. So she makes it as healthy as she can has it with huge salad (greens fill you up plus fiber 😊)

While I eat traditional northern Indian cuisine cause it makes me feel full and keeps me satiated plus I'm vegan so I stick to eating what I know.

Find recipes that you like, tweak them to add more protein and fiber. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject9,, 2021-09-10 08:44:10 , reddit post ," Hey, what you wrote resonated deeply with me.

I (F, 36) started at 94Kg in 2018 and came down to 65Kg last year. I was practicing OMAD and I'm a vegan, I was calorie counting and weighing myself, going on walks - basically I could taste my 50Kg goal gleaming in front of me, my own pot of gold.


Then Shit happened !!!
I let myself drown in my head and no one and nothing made sense anymore.


Fast forward to June 2021 - I'm 80Kg and ready to get back on the saddle, reach 65Kg again and basically telling my body to 'get a move on'. Guess what, its August 2021 and I was 85kg ( so ⬆️ 5Kg plus the 15Kg that I anyways had put on), miserable and doubting everything.


So, I took a breath! And started small. Yes again, after 8 tries (not fails, tries) on 1st September!


My ONLY GOAL for the month of September is not to eat from outside - basically anything that's not cooked in my kitchen. I can eat anything, as many times and with as many helpings. (plus I have cut out sugar completely as it's a trigger for my migraines).

Today 9 days in, I see the following results:


1. I am down to 82Kg from 85kg. (I caved in and weighed myself today morning)
2. I am not spending as much as I used too.
3. I am NOT bloated!
4. I am enjoying cooking again - the ritual of it, the scents, the excitement of recipes.
5. Drinking more water.
6. My bra fits better 🤗




For me, this is working so far - 1 small step and then seeing how positively its affecting me. So maybe do that, try to make 1 change for a small amount of time and see how it goes :)


ps - You got this! 🙂 "

#Tips


1. Take consent prior to taking their contact details or before adding them to any groups of any sorts - telegram, WhatsApp etc.


2. Always take consent (and enforce this) if people are keen on taking photos and/or posting these. One never knows where these pop up and under which title. Noone wants to be outed before they are ready.


3. Have a forum where people feel welcome (look up icebreakers games and a round of their names and pronouns) and heard (small intros of whatever they are comfy/identity with).Mistakes happen and till they are genuine (err on the side of caution) in terms of mis-pronounication.


4. While some are open to all, some groups only have people from the community and its NOT open to allies. Other groups like to pre-check who is attending (and yes the responsibility in on the organiser) so that the meeting is a safe space. Think on these lines and see how you want to start.


5. Use an accessible (transport and money wise) venue. Too rich, too far, too late in the day - these will just raise the barrier to access to the group. Basically ensure to the best of your abilities that it's inclusive and be ready to modify. Once we changed a location last minute as one person couldn't take the stairs.


6. understand whatever is lacking and develop organically. It's a process and you will get there.


7. Have a plan of action if your group is harassed in public or a heckler/troll turns up. Always speak in a clam tone and end the issue (sorry but one need to be mentally prepared - it's half the battle won).




Cheers, you'll do good. Also look up if you have Pride in your city and maybe reach out to them for more pointers. 🌈 "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject9,, 2021-09-03 15:05:10 , reddit post ," I basically bawled my eyes out for a couple of days. Then took a flight to make a last ditch effort, a few weeks before the wedding and it failed miserably. My cousin was in her car and saw the whole thing go down and remarked ' I wish you loved yourself the way you seem to love her'. That comment shattered me - I saw I was being a grovelling idiot to someone who obviously had moved on.


So I took an oath (yes, I'm a nerd and oaths are big part of stories) to love myself, thoroughly and absolutely for the next one year and to NOT date.


And the next year, was loads n loads of crying and processing through. One day I realised that she wasn't the first thing on my mind. saw my own faults, changed my job cause she was also my co-worker, got into coffee, picked up chess again, started baking and finally... learnt how to ride a motorcycle, travelled and put on a little weight. Met up with friends, spent a lot of time on passion projects alone and read a lot. A little more motorcycling across my country.

But at the end of that year, I do believe that I was more myself - I saw myself clearer and did actually fall in love with myself.


I'm glad I took the route I took cause I feel I grew up in that year.

Edit: All this was 10 years ago and I'm now with my partner of 7+ years. I still ride my motorcycle alone though cause somethings are meant to be done for and by oneself 😊 "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject9,, 2021-09-03 14:10:30 , reddit post ," Oh i completely understand that. Trust me, I've been there. What I also did once was to eat a home cooked meal at 650 calories and tracked in how many hours did I feel hungry again (without getting into cravings vs. real hunger). And then the day, I ate a burger at 800 calories and tracked. The difference was a full 180 mins 🤷 and I was like why am I shelling out money to feel hungry so quickly.


Took me about 6 weeks to understand what a 1200 cal for a day looked and felt like. I started by shaving off 100 calories and then sustaining it for a week or 10 days till I reached 1200 a day. Plus on days if I am really like really hungry, I always keep some pre-portioned nuts that will bring me to my maintainance calories for the day (around 300 calories more). My rule is not to eat chips cause I am barrel through an entire pack without a smidgen of control. So it's nuts or an apple or a soup, you know what I'll have if I AM hungry.

I never thought munching a fresh carrot will be so nice and eases my cravings right off (cause I'm like helllloooo either I am hungry enough for a carrot or I just want something. And if its a want then I can totally do it tomorrow WHEN it fits my 1200 😉🙂) "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject9,, 2021-09-03 11:50:18 , reddit post ," Hey you. Dont worry. Got you :)

Some tips I follow/ed so you see if these make sense:

1. Switch off the Noise - everyday people are endorsing or rejecting something new. So, for now, we switch it all off.


2. Track - I tracked all that I was eating for a week. Simple rule - if I'm eating it whether a single chip or a salad; I noted it. Use any free app to track what I was eating and hence the amount of calories I was consuming. Pro tip: Keep noting the timing also.


3. TDEE - I wanted to see what actually should be my total calorie intake and energy I was burning. I used this free website to do so (TDEE calculator) (link)


__so now I had the daily calories I WAS eating and WHAT they should be. I wanted to stick to small deficit (please don't go over 500 calories daily deficit) so I did the following__



4. Understand Food Patterns - Once I saw WHAT I was eating and WHEN - I felt better prepared. Example: I stopped carrying extra change so I couldn't be tempting to sweets or candy or an errant packet of chips 🤷 I planned my meals for the next day in advance so I wouldn't stress and eat out. This helped me with keeping an eye on my calories and budget. 🙏 I stopped eating sweets and boy, did it help with my teeth and my moods 🙌



5. Calories, Calories - Once I started eating more and more at home (cheaper and better prepared too). This helped me realise that (without getting too much into macros) I WAS eating better. More protein helped me stay satiated for longer, hence my snacking reduced and finally eliminated. I was eating what I wanted and portions weren't a problem since I was calories counting thanking to my app.



6. Walking - I started walking to just MOVE. For 5 mins and then it became 15 mins or 4 good songs, all queued up. As my body moved and sweated, I enjoyed it more and MORE, at a gentle pace or not, I liked moving :) (I hope to run a 5k in my life but that's a story for another day)




All I am trying to say is - the day I realised that this is the only body I got so I ain't gonna beat it any more, I want to fall in love with myself :) and all the choices became, I dunno, simple after that.    I skate by on bare minimum and I do whatever I can - sure I make mistakes but I note them down, understand them and move on :) and so can YOU.


Happy to help if you wanna talk more friend :) "

>On top of of all this he's started building pressure for having a kid, which I don't see as a very good idea considering the financial crunch. It seems nothing but a trap to me now.

Not my place to say anything except this anecdote. My previous boss, a few years ago, got married to man whom noone liked particularly but she adored. Soon after marriage when things started to go bad, both sets of parents and her husband pressured her into have a baby. She didn't want a child but thought okay if it will help the marriage. The baby was on the spectrum and within a few months it became evident. The husband left her and she quit her job to shift to her parents place to raise her child.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject9,, 2021-08-27 18:35:31 , reddit post ," I'm just torn you know... When the first Delhi Queer Pride March 🏳️‍🌈 happened, I remember there were 51 of us, scared yet proud, but mostly scared, who walked in CP. Some members of women's hockey team walked with us, with sticks along with an overwhelming cop presence. They were respectful and the onlookers were bemused.

 I still remember, how an uncle came and ask 'aap log koi ad shoot kar rahein hai kya. Bahut beautiful lag raha hai' and my friend said 'uncle gay pride' and uncle sheepishly patted us on the back, gave a thumbs up sign and stepped back. It mean a quiet acceptor 'oh okay' but it was 2007 and we were out.


I have stood in countless police stations, pleading and bailing people out. Cops and us, we are in a relationship by now.

I remember, dancing in the rain when 377 got repealed. Janpath rang with the sounds of dhol, one couldn't get more Delhi.

I remember how hopeful the 4 were, when they filed the petition in Delhi. Its not like more didn't want to, but these could take any shit thrown at them in the papers.

I love my country you know, I love my country very very much. But I don't think I AM LOVED here. Every innocuous 'are you gay' or 'no homo' joke. Every time a guy who thinks he has a magic dick that will turn me straight!!! After a while, sab kuch betuka lagne lagta hai.

Its almost fashionable to have a gay or a lesbian friend in the group but not as a family member. I've consoled too many young queers to believe otherwise.


We are not asking for what's yours. We are asking, nay pleading, for what's ours. My right to be in the ambulance if my partner gets hurt. My right to have a joint bank account. My right to NOT be forced like chattel into straight  marriage. My own rights which do not impede on yours!

Maybe our cries sound so melodious, that they keep stripping us of our very essence just to hear us.

Humari hi galti hai ki hum yahan jeena chahte hain. Sorry!

Satrangi Salam 🏳️‍🌈

Edit:Emotions and grammar are a bad combo.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject9,, 2021-08-25 17:39:54 , reddit post ," There you go my friend. May the mistakes remain mine and more flavour to you 🍜

Broth - saute 1 chopped onion in oil and let that be the base. Then boil the stems of the mushrooms along with corn on the cob, carrot dized, in 1. 2 litre of water. I always add 2 or 3 dry shitake for more oomph. Add a 1/2 inch of fresh ginger, 2-3 cloves of garlic and if you have veggie stock then yes please. I make and freeze cubes of mine so I have them handy to add. Some seaweed  too (in the last 10 mins of the boil) . This time I had a drying leek so put it in too.
Basically anything to enhance the flavour. As it boils, the broth will be imbue the flavours of corn, mushroom garlic and ginger. This will give you 800ml of gold flavoured broth.

Separate the corn from the cob (topping), and strain the rest into your ramen bowl and add soy sauce. This time I found some miso paste so I mixed it in and bam, instantly more awesome.

Toppings -

Green onions/scallions - sliced finely.

The boiled corn (off the cob). I toss in some vegan butter. 🌽

I had a baby radish so thinly sliced for crunch.

I used Bok Choy (blanched in the same water as the noodles post pulling the noodles out)

Sautéed mushrooms - heat your pan, add olive oil, chopped onions, let them brown for like 40 secs, add sliced mushrooms, and heat on high for like 3 mins, stirring occasionally (but I watch my pan like a hawk). The mushrooms will get nicely brown and their flavour intensifies. Sprinkle some black pepper and 1 clove of fresh garlic.

Half a spoon of coconut butter to add to the velvety mouthfeel.

I add some scallion oil also for fragrance.

I boil on low in a cast iron Dutch oven for atleast an hour. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject9,, 2021-08-25 08:46:25 , reddit post ," Contrary to other opinions, I would say, PLEASE DON'T GET A DOG. I'll try and explain it better.

1. Economic reasons - having another being in the house is an added expense. I have 2 dogs and ill give their monthly breakdown - raw chicken at 1000, veggies at 2000, rice 6kg @35, eggs 2 a day @ 80 per dozen. Their annual vaccines and all come to around 4000 per dog. Spaying comes at 5k but I'm sure this depends from vet to vet. Plus you'll buy toys and all.


2. Physical Reasons - if it's a puppy then you have to potty train and generally train the dog too. Your parents might want to do that on their own or hire a trainer. Dogs can and do yank quite hard on their leashes and this can results in falls. A member of my family fell just last week when one of the dogs got spooked by a cat. Plus laws are becoming strict about cleaning up behind your dog and one needs to see if your mom and dad are okay with it. A dog, esp when young need plenty of exercise, without which they tend to chew households items starting with slippers. You needs to truly assess whether your parents can manage a perpetual 3yr old.


3. Parents - Please talk to them and see if they want a dog or not. And I'm saying this with the utmost respect but at times we feel we need to fill a space where as our parents might have things planned and might not want MORE responsibility for another 14-15 years of their lives. Cause one can't leave a dog alone while taking a vacation and kennels also cost (again).


4. Why I feel to say all this - my friends and I feed around 100 dogs through our NGO. It started during the pandemic and I cannot begin to explain how many people abandoned or were forced to give up their dogs due to monetary or other reasons. One lab got adopted and abandoned 3 times - with the 3rd owner choosing to put the animal down. I've seen cases where parents have got a pup (desi or otherwise) and few months later, surrendered them as 'the dog is too active' or keep the dog tied up 'as the house gets dirty' etc.


My humblest of requests would be to talk honesty with your parents, maybe your mom enjoys books or movies or an activity that can engage her without tiring her out completely. Or maybe she wants a dog and welcomes everything that comes with and loves the furry companion 🐶

I'm happy to talk more about this but high maintenance pets are not a solution to fill a space.

My own cousin had to surrender the dog he got as a surprise for his parents when he was shifting to Japan. His parents straight up said no, we cannot handle a dog at our age (they both are 58-60).

Indian recipes are easier to adapt and raw materials are easier to find.

Use hot water to keep the contact time low, hence not have a bitter taste and do not use the handle to tighten the pot.

If you want then please check out Hoffman' video, most of us use that only. (I started using hot water after that only although using moka pots for the longest time).

All the best, my friend.

A decade later, I have realised that in order to be with someone that I desire, I need to up my game also - emotionally and what I bring to the table. I am with a person now who inspires me to be better and kinder each day, just by being herself. Sure we have fights but on the issue and we promised each other that 'us' is worth building. So we work on it each day! Till the time, we wake up each morning, grateful to next to the person, we are good.

Look, search and accept yourself. Own yourself to yourself atleast. Others come later and the fact if you tell them or not. First you need to be at peace with yourself. Else it gets all tangled inside love and that shit messes us up.



>But turns out, most of the people I know do care.

Yes. I might sound like I don't but I get it. Again I am not asking you to either come out OR stay in the closet. I am asking you to to ACCEPT yourself first. When our belief in our own selves gets cemented then what others say doesn't matter. Like now, when I meet people who are spouting shit,  they are only showing their own identity through that and it ain't a reflection on myself.

>If I accept myself but others don't, what would I do? After all the things my parents did for me, I can't do this to them. I'd rather take the bullet myself. I'm ready to do it. But I don't know how.

First make peace with yourself and then with others. I feel you are thinking so far ahead that its getting jumbled.

Figure out who you are and what you want.

Your sexual identity (straight or gay or bi) is only one part of you but ain't the be all and end all of the world. You are a composite of hopes and beliefs and failures and love.

Accept yourself as confused or searching at this moment. Explore how you feel. The world can come in later love, first you need to be at peace with whomsoever you choose to be. Journaling helps (make an e-journal with password on a website or a blog through a different email, if you don't want anyone discovering your writing).

Not to be robbed of my angst plus empowered with what my dadi said, I went to my dad and came out to him. His response was ""I don't understand it but you do you. We might not agree on everything but I love you"". Took him 3 days to get it and then it was again. Then it was to everyone in my family who didn't care at all. I learnt that day, that my family didn't care 2 hoots whether I was gay or straight, they just wanted me to be happy (and to do the dishes). They all continue to be my biggest support.

Tamasha - while it means a road side theatre but colloquially if one is creating a ruckus or attracting attention due to their rowdy, crass behaviour/tantrum, one can saying they are doing tamasha.

Misaal - being a good example to others.

Basically I used to have anger issues and she taught me to control and redirect it. A lot of people use to tease me and I used to get in trouble. She used to say when people are unfulfilled or in pain, they take it out in others and I shouldn't be a roadside circus act for them (cheap thrills) but through my behaviour I can be a better version of myself. So if/when people are gonna notice me, they should see me as an example rather than a sideshow.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject9,, 2021-08-03 04:39:18 , reddit post ," >You know there will absolutely be no punishment given to her, so is it unfair to slap her back ?

Sorry brother but in my books 2 wrongs don't make a right. If someone was to slap her then how are they any better than her, being above the law and taking it into their own hands.

In my case, I've seen a woman slap a cop (while her husband argued and screamed with him). my friend and I literally held them at the scene while she screamed, spat (thankfully it was pre-covid) and gave gallis to esp to me saying woman ain't helping a woman. That time all I said was as a woman I will give gavahi in court that she hit a cop and woman to woman - she was being an entitled li'l bitch. We helped, as the cop at the scene was alone (public was only watching) and had called a lady constable (and back up). We did it with full support of the cop but we didn't go around beating her or her husband. 20mins of this tamasha and then more cops arrived. But in the meanwhile, we didn't commit more violence, only restrained her and husband.

 That's the only way I saw myself being fair - cause I need to live with my actions everyday, long after such shit is forgotten by all. But ghar jaake bahut baar face wash kiya tha 😂

And if you see the various posts esp the twitter thread, this woman clicks posts and is a general entitled busybody types. She even posted against the person who slapped and raved against that person saying that he hit a Hindu woman and referring to military.  I am drawing the inference that she uses social-economic, gender, religion when it suits her regularly. Thankfully this time she has been caught! "

2. Chop all veggies to have the same size as your pasta - in my case, farfalle. Heat the pot, add Oilve oil and saute all veggies, starting with the hardiest first (for me it was carrots, capsicum, cauliflower, then peas) to give them a slight char/browning. Leave the rest of the oil in and take the veggies out.

3. Add the chopped onion, then chopped garlic and then after a 1-2 mins, the tomatoes (can be from a can or like me, dipped in boiling water to peel them), salt and pepper, pinch of sugar and basically you reduce the sauce. Cover and cook for 20-25 mins with dash of water. Basically the raw taste of the sauce should go and it should now taste delicious and be thicker. Add a little garam masala, red chilli powder and Maggi sauce to bump the flavours.

4. Add the veggies and give it another 10 mins. Add the pasta water too.

5. Add the pasta and toss it all together :)

eRisk2022-T3_Subject9,, 2021-07-11 10:58:56 , reddit post ," Also keep the pup sequestered away till he/she gets all the shots. Remember these shots have to be followed up yearly (vet will explain). The most dangerous to a young pup is parvo-virus but the vet should be able to gauge if the pup is sick. Plus always start the training early, do not listen to people who say to start around 4 months or 6 months or apne aap doggie seek lete hain. Do positive re-enforcement training - look up Zak George (I have a new puppy, now what) videos, he is a good trainer on youtube.

And remember the first 6 months will be the hardest as the pup adapts to you, your routine and his/her new life. But it only has you and will be completely dependent on you so don't lose hope and keep training. :) things tend to settle down. Dogs forget what they have done 5-7 minutes later so one has to correct the behaviour with positive consequences then and there.


Also keep anything, ANYTHING, you don't want destroyed or chewed - out of reach. I learnt this the hard way when my pup chewed through my very expensive wallet.


And for anything else, feel free to reach out. And welcome to the club of 'stop that. What do you have in your mouth. Lets go walkies'. :) "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject9,, 2021-07-11 10:22:04 , reddit post ," If the pup is pedigreed then there is a certificate that comes with. Also if any vaccine has been administered then they will have a certificate. Else you will start with one against worms in their tummy (all have them, no big deal but the vaccine is given based on the pup' weight). After that, the pup will get vaccinated as per the schedule with your vet. If you don't have a vet and are in South Delhi - I will highly recommend Dr. Sharma in Gulmohar Park).

When you get the pup, check how alert the puppy is, can waddle around you and is interested in food and water. Post that take the pup for a vet check up. "

That's a lovely thought, yup, that's it.

You've done your bit. I thank you. You can let go now!

You were there, growing and wrapping me up in your squishy arms when things felt like shit and I was looking for comfort in endless bags of crisps. You protected my body from horrid people on the road cause due to you, I was BIG and then Noone could see the scared little girl inside. You cradled my young lesbian heart cause it was not the time or space to blossom and you didn't judge me.

You didn't judge me for endless take outs, crap from crinkly packets and you stuck to me even through endless fad exercises and diets. Remember pink spandex!

I have a new and true friend now, you will like them. She is helping me grow out of our relationship and fall into one with my own body. She got me interested in nutrition and cooking (I am singing again in the kitchen) and she too doesn't judge but like you, shows up. Her name is CICO and I think I like her. She is brutally honest and affects me greatly.

So you, fat, Mon ami, can let go. I am safe now, in good hands. You will be around but in healthier ways. Thank you for being there!

Regards,

Crunchy "

1. Gloves tend to make people lax. If anyone is wearing gloves, please show utmost precaution and spray sanitizer on them and dispose them properly. We have actually started encouraging people to use them as last resort or if actively involved in caregiving.

2. Never touch your mask. Always take them off with the ear-band, if both hands as if they were Ray-Ban glasses, and keep them in the sun (ideally in a paper bag) for a couple of hours post usage. This is esp for N95 as they ain't washable. This protocol decontaminates them post usage. (the other day I was telling this to someone and he is like 'agar dhool lag gayi toh.

They started donating vaccines and started a age based vaccination drive. Organised religion is big here and every fucker worth their salt was off celebrating something or the other.

We also have elections in one of the biggest and most populous of states in 7 bloody phases cause certain leaders wanted to campaign and everyone was being invited to attend their rallies.

 WE FUCKED UP and believed our leaders while a whole bunch of leaders lied and tried to cover it up,up until the tsunami hit us and we are dying on the streets. The funeral pyres are burning 24*7 that my friends are getting ashes in their houses which are 6Km away from the cremation grounds, my friends as doctors have lost all semblance of life or normalcy and are fighting a battle without oxygen or beds or ventilators. Alternative cures are flooding the market that are making us their test subjects and WE WILL STILL HAVE A RELIGIOUS TRAVEL (AMARNATH YATRA) CAUSE WE ARE FUCKERS!!!

 I got covid as I volunteer at testing camps (and for 8 days my lungs burnt everytime I took a breath) and while I'm grateful to be alive and I will Volunteer again but I am most amazed at my country' utter disregard for rules even at the expense of personal lives.

Edit: and for anyone, honestly, who even tries to put a spin on this - One day you too will meet your maker and I hope your spin works on God. 35,000 crores of building is deemed essential work while we die on the streets gasping for breath. Fuck you and fuck anyone who lies - as a Healthcare person, we have been shouting since last year that we need to be better prepared but nai, hum ko hi chutiya bola gaya. Humko bola gaya ki hum dara rahein sab, ab thali apne sar pe maar lo (We were told we are lying and tried to frighten everyone, now take that plate and hit it on your own head).

For anyone interested, see how my Delhi is burning and how the state of UP has collapsed cause people believed our leaders when they should have listened to doctors. Its bloody painful. I've lost so many already!!!

Alternatively I also use Butters and More - they make a host of butters from almond and Pista etc. 1 tsp of their butter mixed in water serve atleast a good enough substitute in smoothies and curries.

I hope as the Vegan population increases, such items become easier and cheaper to buy. "

Basically you have to wash and chop a pineapple - puts the rinds and core in a 1 Gallon Jar - add Piloncillo but can do with brown sugar (I am doing with Gud, Indian equivalent to PIloncillo), few cloves and 1 stick of cinnamon and fill it with water and put a covering on it. Check on daily as pineapple fermentation is fast. If you see any white foam, just skim it.

Then I do a quick 2F after straining it and bottling it in swingtop for 2 days.


I learnt to do it through this video.

1. Kindly negotiate and fix not to pay 1/2 month rent to the broker (if using) and 1 month security + 1 month rent.

2. Ensure to take the meter reading and put all the nitty gritty on paper. Any additional charges right down to garbage, water, security, misc. If you have to pay it above your rent, jot it down.

3. Memorize the metro map or atleast have it on you. There are quite a few areas where you can live and while they might be a little further away but might be cheaper. Look at Sheikh Sarai, Hauz Khaz areas. You still have the access to yellow line. Even Jang Pura a possibility.

4. Figure the routes out and see a few places before finalising one. I actually loved living in the DDA in Shahpur Jat but different strokes for different folks.

5. Checkout flats without brokers and flat with flatmates type Facebook pages. One can always find good deals there.

In 2018, I was alone, in south India, where I didn't speak any language, and the village had a old lord Shiva temple. The people from whom I was renting a room, urged me to go to there and when I entered the temple, I was completely out of place. But It was peaceful and as I stood before the idol of Lord Shiva, I folded my hands above my head and shut my eyes, the entire temple erupted with music. It was transformational - I think I felt God at that moment. When I opened my eyes, the temple musicians were playing their evening ragas. I came out with tears of gratitude.

Last year, I dreamt of a person in black robes, holding my hand and making me take a stone staircase and upon climbing I came across a lake where Lord Shiva was lying down and sleeping. I started a jaap of gratitude and that night, in my dreams a male voice spoke to me about visualisation of my dreams. I woke up with a start and a few months later I am still trying to process all this.

I need someone who understands these better than me to guide me towards a direction as currently I feel ain't doing enough somehow. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject9, Basics to Recipes and Reducing Kitchen Stress , 2020-12-11 14:43:46 , reddit post ," I am putting some basics down, that I put together for my free  cooking classes, to broke ass college students and I myself still go by these pointers. They are time and money savers in long run.

Basics to Recipes and Reducing Kitchen Stress

1. Staples - Review your meals and see what you eat the most - it can be rice, lentils, pasta, noodles, all kinds of flours etc. These should always be bought monthly and stored nicely so they are always at hand. They are your Staples for a reason. For ex. Whenever I can't decide what to eat the next day, I always soak white chickpeas. That ways in the morning, I will always have access to, after a quick boil, to boiled chickpeas for salads, curries, heck even chickpeas rice stir fry. If I have the ingredients - dish will work itself out. I always have these plus spaghetti, flour and basic dry noodles in the house.

For me onions, tomatoes, garlic, ginger, lemon and potatoes are also Staples.


2. Cuisines and Spices- Choose all the cuisines you like to cook. I suggest to start with 2 or 3. Once you have decided, look up commonalities and you will see spices overlap.

For example - I mainly cook North Indian, French, Japanese and between these I can cook (with a few additions) the basics of Mexican and South Indian, some basic Thai, Cantonese and Korean dishes too.

This help you understand also how to substitute spices and more importantly use up the spices in your kitchen before they go stale. They are expensive.

3. Whole Spices - Always, I mean always, try and buy whole spices. Not cinnamon powder but basic cinnamon bark (not the expensive smooth kind also.)same cloves, star anise, nutmeg, cardamom etc. They charge you for peeling and grinding and the pretty box (most of the times). Whole spices retain their Oils hence they last longer, are more fragrant and can be roasted/toasted prior to cooking for a few seconds.

4. Sauces - Gok explains it much better than I can hope to so I am putting a link for his video below. In essence, for every cuisine atleast for basic level, there are certain sauces one should have. The whole idea is to reduce the 4pm panic about what to cook because you have a cupboard full of stuff that goes well together. Whichever cuisine floats your boat - Thai then have coconut milk at hand, can't do chines/japanese with Soy and I personally always have oyster (for my partner), Woostershire, Sriracha, mirin, vinegar in the house.

(link)

5. Veggies - please buy seasonal cause they will cheap, suited to the season, not pumped with additives to keep them looking pretty. Plus a lot of youtube cooks and blogs do seasonal recipes so you won't be bored.


6. Utensils - a lot of people get deterred because when they cook it burns or some other mishap happens and they feel demotivated. Plus one has classes and tests and fun to be do. Buy 3 or 4 basic but the best quality utensils you can buy. Your utensil should perform it's function, that all. 1 or 2 saucepans (for 2-3 people so you can boil stuff in it plus make sauces and soups and curries), 1 or 2 pans for your omlettes, stir frys, 1 rice maker (only if you eat rice the way, well I do, that means 2 times a day) and a couple of lids. And 2 silicone spatulas, 1 strainer (works for noodles, pastas, veggies, dumplings etc) , 1 tongs cause these are wayyyyy better than anything else and wash easy.

You don't need a tagine to make a curry. Similarly I use my steamer to make momos, Dhokla and idli.


And last but not in the least, make a LIST of veggies and fresh additional produce like fruits AND then go to buy it all.

That ways you are also planning and sorting your week's worth of meals plus the Staples are already there.

And and And use OIL - most recipes are by cooks who have been cooking them for a while. One learns to eyeball these things in the long run but when in doubt an additional 1/2tsp (then the recipe calls for) of oil will save your stir-frys, curries, meats from burning.


We eat 2 to 3 times a day. Might as well cook to the best of our abilities, save money and impress our tummies. Cheers.


And as always, please add your tips and tricks that you use to eat healthier and cheaper. 😁👍 "

HATERS within the community whether you are LGBTQIA+ or any other mfing alphabet, WTF dude! Weren't you ever scared or traumatized or bashed for not conforming to the ideas of others. Don't you remember that PAIN. TRANSFORM yourself and your hate/anger into acceptance please before you are left out on the sidewalk alone and forgotten.

ACCEPTANCE OF ALL DOESN'T TRANSLATE INTO BEING A DOORMAT!

I am 35 and fucking pissed Indian lesbian who is tired of losing people, especially my younger friends to BULLYING !!! You never pick on people who will give it back to you and to prey on the vulnerable from within the community is just so heinous and downright evil that I truly wish nothing of note of you.


AND YOU, ALL OF YOU, beautiful beautiful PEOPLE, who feel threatened or have had shit hurled at you in these online forums that are supposed to be safe spaces -

I SEE YOU, I HEAR YOU, I AM OLDER SO I MIGHT TAKE A MINUTE TO CATCH UP WITH THE CORRECT PRONOUNS BUT I STAND WITH YOU, FUCKING ALL THE WAY!!!

Struggle is struggle and we have to be cognizant of that. Stay strong and this SHIT does get better!

You all are worth so much than your weight in gold, DON'T YOU FORGET THAT.

and most importantly, seek help and support if you are feeling alone, there are many of us out there who will love and support you.

YOU ARE NOT ALONE, repeat this daily!

eRisk2022-T3_Subject9, My India... , 2020-10-01 14:06:48 , reddit post ," I grew up in India! An idea of India more than its geographical boundaries, was taught to us in the 90s - we were supposed to be harbingers of peace and bring renown to our country. J'ai Jawan J'ai Kisan!I promise you, we were taught love and à belief in universal brotherhood (India is my country and all Indians are my brother's and sisters... Yup that one, that pledge). We were supposed to work hard and take our place in the world.

 In 2000s, I came to college and as a woman I was taught to be fearless and to stand tall against patriarchy and to use my privilege in society to work for those to whom this was denied. Volunteer work was compulsory, we were shown the good and the ugly and taught to figure our spaces between. We saw Rang de basanti and bought what the movie sold us and believed candlelight vigil will show us the face of Jessica's killer. We thought and we dreamed. College ended and life happened - corporate jobs, NGOs, postings abroad beckoned us. But we returned to lend our shoulders, when Nirbhaya happened- we protested, we the many, who were lathi charged and  water cannoned.

And then last year where so many laws were passed that they ended up strengthening our tired resolve - we fought, each hour and each day, at each sit in and each protest, the fabled dilli ki sardi, was warmed by singing songs of resistence. We thought that people will surely realise reason and logic and compassion and not say that we traded our love for our country  for packets of biryani. We were chased and picked up and dropped at random bus-stops at the edges of Delhi. The marks of the lathi from my thighs took almost 7 weeks to fade but many were injured and I feel it's narcissistic of me to talk about myself. We were pushed out from Jantar Mantar, the centre of Delhi, so we took refuge in its corners. But then came February  and few of us rushed back from all corners of India because the tyre market had been burnt and I read about Akbari. So i saw how they looted our safety and rioted in my Delhi, but being a 1000 yr city breeds resilience into the very water, so we ran medical camps, carried dead bodies and the pregnant to the hospitals, collected donations and donated ration kits and then ran food kitchens for the our fellow Indians who got turned into migrants cause by succeeding covid lockdowns. Why, cause kyunki yeh mera dharm hai - this is what was taught to us - to help. By July, we we were battered and bruised and tired. Tiredness that somehow had seeped into my bones and made a pact with cynicism to take up residence.


And this poor 19 yr old was gang raped, her spine was broken, and then when she died, they didn't let her family see her body and she was burned, turned into a rape statistic. Something broke inside me and most of the people I have spoken with. I feel like an outsider in my beloved country, I don't know my place anymore. I feel cheated somehow! I am so sorry Ms. Valmiki we failed you - we the idéalists of India with our rose tainted glasses and glib all encompassing morals. I was born in UP, I know what the state is and rather was. I dunno it anymore - haven't been back in 3 years.

All I know is that when we had strength, we should have fought harder earlier, that you were born in a safe world. I'm sorry my sister, I'm sorry.
(This is a rant. It's a navel gazing exercise, It's my catharsis cause I have never felt so tired and so powerless in my own country ever before and a part of my brain keeps yelling at me that the worse is yet to come so I should hoard my tears). This ain't intended to hurt anyone and if this pisses you off, I'm sorry. I want this here, at one place where noone knows me so i can keep coming back to reflect. "

Generally my partner, bless her, does this cause once I'm asleep, it's all lights out. (Sidenote: she has photos of one of our dogs sleeping on me and I didn't wake up)

Anywho, today, I set my wristwatch' alarm to buzz and it woke me up at 5.25am so I let the dogs out. I was beaming with pride and I excitedly tapped her and said, 'Hon, guess who let the dogs out. Me :)' and I ended up waking her 😔 she can't go back to sleep once wake so today too, despite best of intentions, she woke up.

She did say everyday is an adventure (we've been together 7 yrs) and has been laughing the whole day about this, called my dad about it too (and I heard him roaring too 😂) and also played the song a few times 😊

eRisk2022-T3_Subject9, Mindset Matters 💪👍 , 2020-08-07 07:15:23 , reddit post ," The first time I did #75Hard, I slipped up on Day 5. It's been 2 weeks or so since then and not only I haven't hopped back onto the wagon, I've have put on a few Kilo too as I was wallowing plus pulled my back getting 'too' enthusiastic and doing 45mins strenuous workout. And then it hit me - I needed to start at the basis of this certified madness 😉.

I listened to Andy' podcast again. The rules couldn't be simpler. It's was he says about doing what we can with what we have struck me! He says 45 Mins but he NEVER said that I have to become a human flag overnight - that mistake is mine ALONE. If I have to be honest, I'll say that I 'broke' my streak cause I felt I couldn't do it and then used that failure as an an excuse to further dig my own hole.

So, I have planned a 75*2x plan of 45 Mins workouts (I'm overweight so i can't do what most people do) and thrown in a healthy mix of stretching, baby weights, long long walks (that's one thing I can do) so that I don't flounder in that area. And this is for me, overcoming a hump :) I'm tired of taking the easy way out.

I'm not the fittest challenger (35,F) but I'll definitely become a finisher of #75Hard.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject9, My Understanding Hunger VS. Cravings Changed in 72 Hours , 2020-07-10 20:13:38 , reddit post ," I am on a water fast currently and this realisation just hit me!!! I'm still kinda processing it and this is more of a post for myself but also had to share cause it helped me.

Background - I've been on OMAD for the last 2 yrs (on and off) and my frequently water fast for upto 48 to 60 hours. Somehow haven't been able to Crack it so far.

Present - I'm on a 72(+) hour fast and while the first 60hrs were a relative breeze, hunger wise, on the 61st hr hunger started bitchslapping me around. And then it hit me. I missed chewing!!! Like not hungry but just the action! And somehow along with that I was able to differentiate between my hunger and cravings. Upon listening to my body I've realised that while normal hunger starts under my navel (and layers of belly fat) but it's a gentle and it's a low lying feeling  (I'm aware of it but it's manageable and chill) vs craving or mental hunger which comes as intense as as heat in June and subsumes everything. But as its this intense for me, it only lasts 5 or so mins and I need to do something to distract myself. I physically talked to myself to back off from buying chips and a coke!!! And these come like 4 times today. And each time I didn't succumb, it was a new craving, more intense but for a lesser duration. (I find it extremely interesting).

Result - I've crossed the 72hr mark and now hoping to go for a 100 🤞🤗

TL/DR: Finally learnt the body signals between mental and physical hunger, used them to not succumb to cravings and finally cross the 72hr mark. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject9," Be Kind, a little Rewind. ", 2020-06-01 11:18:25 , reddit post ," When I was in college 20,000 years ago, Pride was not a thing. But I was supported by my straight friends and professors. I remember some of them pooled money and bought me a rainbow wallet, something I held dear and used till it was in tatters. And then the first Delhi Pride happened and it wasn't easy but there were 51 of us walking and rest is history...

And It just truly warms my heart that amongst the trails and tribulations that all of you go through each day, we also having growing acceptance of being Queer and owning it in the truest sense. How we have each other's back and aren't deterred by stupid bigots and we dream are Queer dreams.

I wanted to write this cause i saw a post by someone who wore the Pride flag to their college event, and it gave my older lesbian heart aflutter - of Hope ✊.

And I'll request one thing which all you fabulous people might already be doing. I request you all to BE KIND - to yourself and to others. Be kind in your expectations, be kind when you make mistakes, be kind during your break-ups! Just try to Be Kind.

Cause in my 20 or so years, I've come to realise one thing - Noone will push our agenda of acceptance except us!  And we are more than a flavour of the month to companies, we are more than an ad campaign or a fabulous pair of shoes.

And in order to achieve our rainbow dreams, we need to dream together. We are STRONGER, TOGETHER! 🌈💪🌈 "

I was called forward to open the bag as they couldn't figure out a gadget inside - as I stepped towards him, the cop said 'Sir... "" and for the first time I replied ""Ma'am"" and this is where my story starts.
[ In India, it's very common to be called Sir (if you are not overtly feminine) regardless of, well everything. It always gets my goat but as an obese person (and that too one wearing Bermuda shorts and flowing t-shirts) wanting to escape limelight, I have always said yes and moved on. But to be honest, I never liked it.
Today when the cop called me Sir, he said that to the new me. The New me, the shorts and lose t-shirt wearing BUT empowered woman who has lost 21Kg (have to lose many more but I know I will) and for the first time isn't shy of speaking up.]


And then the most magical thing happened, the cop said ""Ma'am, would you open the bag"" and I happily complied and then I cried later in the train  with joy that as a 34yr old, I CAN stand up for myself, it doesn't have to be big things, and that I can be called a Ma'am in shorts and all this confidence from weightloss.

I was doing everything right and losing consistently. Then 3 days ago my biggest support, my champion, my partner told me that they are tired of listening to my weightloss journey (amongst other shit). It broke my heart in a way i didn't think was possible. They have lost 60Kg themselves so I know they under stand the struggle so I know its not just my weightloss but I digress. For the last 3 days, I have purposely stuffed my body with junk food of all kinds even though I feel sick plus all will to do any thing healthy has left - its like i am sabotaging myself with intent. I am lost and I need help finding my bearings.

Edit - my partner came and spoke with me. According to them, while I was consistently going forward, their own WL journey wasn't moving forward and hence they got disheartened and wanted to distance themselves cause they thought they attitude would negatively affect me. I told them that for a while both of us can keep our journeys personal and compare notes maybe a month down the line (also showed them this subreddit) . 🙏🙏🙏 Would like to thank this group and all the people who helped me. I plan to do this journey with this group in the near future. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject9, For MODS , 2019-07-31 14:04:27 , reddit post ," Hi,

Sorry for coming straight to the point but can we please have some guidelines about postings on here. Cause currently a lot of posts are from day old accounts looking for 'friends' and the language of such posts is same and after seeing such cases in north India- people are trapped to reveal their identities and then black mailed or worse.
Is this a sub, where we play out our kinks or look for partners or it is just a news sub? exactly is this subreddit?
I just read an entire ad looking for a bull. Can we have a kinks collective-esqu subreddit where people can freely interactive without worrying about any backlash or their post getting lost between two news articles.
I completely believe that here in India we need the anonymity that internet provides us and loneliness is huge in the our community because we are isolated in IRL. Hence some guidelines would help all of us navigate this subreddit better. Plus maybe some active discussion topics and interactions would make this a more active Reddit. Cheers. 🏳️‍🌈 "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject9, Pivot Point - My Fast is stronger than Home Delivery Apps , 2019-07-20 09:34:20 , reddit post ," You will never believe what just happened with me and I am quite pumped. I am on a 72 hr water fast and 32 hr in, out of habit I started scrolling through food delivery apps to see if anything caught me fancy (normally everything does and it ends up in my tummy). I saw all my previously ordered dishes, each photo reminded me of their taste on my mouth but AFTER 40 MINS, I (for the first TIME) just shut the apps without ORDERING ANYTHING. I JUST DIDN'T FEEL LIKE IT, I WANTED TO CONTINUE MY FAST. I don't possess iron will guys - this has NEVER HAPPENED Before well with me atleast. I am in shock but feeling slightly less fragile - hopefully onwards and upwards from this point towards my first successful 72 hr fast.

I just wanted to share this here cause in the past I have drawn strength and inspiration from all you amazing people and for the first time i have something to give - we can do it guys, 1 hr and 1 day at a time💓🙏

TL, Dr - First time didn't order home delivery during my fast. "
