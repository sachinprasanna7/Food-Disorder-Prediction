I get you completly. I was also raped and I just don’t know how to deal with it. I also get why you don’t wamt to report it, I haven’t either. I’d really recommend finding someone you can trust (for me its my therapist). I haven’t talked about the rape itself in detail in therapy but I seem to find a lot of comfort to have someone who I can trust and just vent to.
I don’t know how useless your mom is, does she now about the rape? If so you could ask her to go to (trauma)counseling. If she knows but doesn’t want to aknowledge it, then it’s better to keep her out of the picture, you really don’t need a more toxic envoirement. If she doesn’t know and you don’t want to tell her then I suggest asking for therapy and just say you need someone to vent to.( or find another excuse)
What I’m also trying to do is to just accept myself. I know this isn’t easy, especially in the situation your in. You really don’t need to be super positive. Just try with accepting.

I truly wish you all the best❤️you are so strong and i see you, i believe you❤️❤️❤️keep going!
