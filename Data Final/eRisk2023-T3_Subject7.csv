'love' has always been a difficult concept. honestly don't think have ever 'loved' someone, the closest have gotten is feeling appreciation towards someone for doing something or allowing an opportunity. 'care' is difficult too. it's hard to care for someone, as that requires an emotional connection most of the time, which feel am incapable of.\n\n4. am aromantic and asexual, but have been in some romantic relationships against better judgement. it was when was young, and new to those concepts. didn't understand what a romantic relationship was, and didn't want to hurt the feelings of those people asking you out. tried it out, and never again. it was the most uncomfortable have ever been in life ever.""
