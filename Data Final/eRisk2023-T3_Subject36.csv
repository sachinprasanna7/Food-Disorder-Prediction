There\'s a section in chapter 1 explaining how newborns are able to differentiate between different languages: the example given is between Dutch and Japanese. However, it\'s also mentioned that ""the ability to differentiate sounds in two languages of the same phonological family appears a little later"".\n\nA few questions arise from this:\n1. What are these phonological families?\n2. How many of them are there?\n3. Which languages exist within the same phonological families? (an example of two languages which a newborn wouldn\'t be able to differentiate between)\n4. When do babies gain the ability to distinguish these two, if ever?\n\nI assume that phonological relationships and historical relationships between languages differ: considering that languages from the same historical family can sound very different (Russian and Hindi) and vice versa (Tamil and Hindi).\n\nI\'ve scoured the internet for more information but with no success so I thought I\'d ask here.\nAny help is much appreciated :)' "
