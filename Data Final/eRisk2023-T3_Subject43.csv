One of the things to remember though is once your anxiety is calm enough, you have to force it more. Go further. Go longer. And I think that\xe2\x80\x99s where a lot of people stagnate. Or they never figure out what the underlying panic is from. Like what are you scared of? Cause it\xe2\x80\x99s not outside. There\xe2\x80\x99s a scenario that plays in your head when you feel that fear. Work through it in a safe place, trigger it like you\xe2\x80\x99re experiencing it in a safe environment and learn to sit with it comfortably. Mine was fear of passing out or a health emergency. So I kept doing stuff while I felt those symptoms like dizziness and eventually I learned that no matter what I am in control of the situation. I may feel dizzy but I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to die or get sick. And remember: you can always go back. You are never trapped. You are capable and you can trust your body to look out for you.

While some exposures required me to just rip the bandaid off, I also did smaller exposures in the beginning until I felt more confident in myself. For example, I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t be home alone or shower alone in the beginning my agoraphobia was so severe. So I started by showering alone repeatedly to get used to that. Eventually I felt strong enough to drive a massive trigger road by myself. \n\nAbsolutely set backs and I still have it sometimes where my brain fights me.

I\xe2\x80\x99ve had panic attacks since I was around 5-6 years old. But the fear kept me in my agoraphobia. I had to restructure myself to embrace the panic attack (which is very very difficult) and to learn to sit with discomfort rather than run. I would reassure myself panic attacks cannot kill you or cause serious damage and they ALWAYS have to end at some point. It cannot last forever, your body just can\xe2\x80\x99t sustain that. \n\nI do still have symptoms but I would still consider myself recovered. I\xe2\x80\x99ve recovered in the past and symptoms have totally disappeared for years so I know it\xe2\x80\x99s possible but I think I\xe2\x80\x99m still early on and I need to earn my secure attachment to the outer world for a bit longer. After 2-4 years, I felt totally agoraphobia free in the past. I still get pangs of anxiety, tight throat, sweaty hands when driving. Or if I have plans that I feel trapped in, I remind myself I am never trapped and it helps. I feel anxiety about plans still but I refuse to let it stop me.

When you\xe2\x80\x99re damaged as much as we are with C-PTSD we tend to repeat cycles - we go after emotionally unavailable/abusive people (codependency) or we put people off because we haven\xe2\x80\x99t dealt with our trauma. We find it safer to seclude ourselves than to open up to true intimacy because it makes us uncomfortable. We never received or knew true tender emotional love/care and some never felt parental love at all. We were neglected and so we accept this pattern of neglect, don\xe2\x80\x99t stand up to it, and in the end attract more of it because we have not dealt with our underlying trauma. Some of the time, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if this is the case with OP, I wondered why no one ever reached out to me and I was mad and depressed because I had no socialization. I didn\xe2\x80\x99t understand why I never could form deep friendships. Then I realized it was because I didn\xe2\x80\x99t know how to form bonds and intimacy at all that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t toxic/avoidant. I would run away, ignore texts, not open up, seclude myself until people just stopped trying to invite me because - I never showed up. Relationships do go both ways and require emotional vulnerability on both ends. If you view yourself as flawed and that no one will like you if you are the real you, you will always keep people at arms length out of fear. I\xe2\x80\x99d say OP is suffering from avoidant attachment and freeze trauma response. OP needs to focus on shifting their world view from \xe2\x80\x9cpeople will abandon me, I can\xe2\x80\x99t get close, no one likes me\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cI am worth loving and healthy relationships, I can set boundaries, and people will like me for who I actually am rather than putting on a show\xe2\x80\x9d. It\xe2\x80\x99s not that we aren\xe2\x80\x99t capable, we never learned how to connect emotionally and were abused when we tried. We are damaged and our brains have learned it\xe2\x80\x99s safer not to try than to potentially be abused or abandoned again. I HIGHLY recommend the book C-PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving as this covers overcoming this trauma much more in depth and better than I have here.' "

Idk your story or if childhood abuse caused your C-PTSD but for a lot of us we feel empty because we lack parental acceptance and love. We were neglected on a deep emotional and spiritual level. We need to grieve the loss of this childhood right for ourselves and be compassionate during it. Letting yourself feel your feelings - anger, sadness, denial is important to helping heal the void. Then you can work on mending it by filling the hole with love for yourself and parenting yourself in a way your parents never did. Highly recommend inner child work for this.' "

Gynecologists typically will put you on birth control and blow you off. I\xe2\x80\x99m in the medical field with experience as a lab tech so here\xe2\x80\x99s the recommendation I would do: transvaginal ultrasound. Bloodwork including: testosterone (free and total), estrogen, progesterone, DHEAs, OGTT (with insulin levels tested fasting and post-prandial), prolactin, cortisol, A1C, LH, FSH, TSH/Thyroid profile, AMH, and SHBG. That gives you a comprehensive hormonal baseline to go from and decide if things are out of whack. The ultrasound may reveal cysts but they aren\xe2\x80\x99t totally necessary as long as you have 2/3 criteria: symptoms, cysts on imaging, or off bloodwork. The treatment for mine that I\xe2\x80\x99m on is Metformin 1,000mg, Ozempic 0.5mg (titrating up to 1mg slowly), and Lo Loestrin Fe birth control. Birth control helps add estrogen and progesterone to your system while the others balance insulin and the Metformin can lower testosterone/androgens. Spironolactone is another common PCOS medication as it lowers testosterone and can help with hirsutism and acne. Another option if you struggle with PCOS-like symptoms but can\xe2\x80\x99t get these medications is Ovasitol as this mimics the benefits of Metformin. Since these medications, I have had two natural periods, lost weight, and feel so much better.' "

I get the feeling your household was tense and people did not talk about the hard emotions in life like anger and depression. These things were hushed and covered up - this comes out in the dream in the form of no talking but the boy understanding you. This is a subconscious desire from childhood - to be understood on a mental level by (probably) a father figure in your life. You still feel on some level you have not grown out of your childhood because you\xe2\x80\x99re having a hard time coming to terms with how you grew up, you feel it\xe2\x80\x99s unfair and that there was \xe2\x80\x9cno end in sight\xe2\x80\x9d to the suffocation you felt growing up.

You feel you were punished for being a kid and feel you cannot get in touch with that sad, lonely inner child that still lives inside you.

Since acting was something you used to enjoy and now you\xe2\x80\x99re \xe2\x80\x9cfailing\xe2\x80\x9d at it, it would suggest you feel out of sorts with your old interests and hobbies.

To me, the acting aspect of this dream would symbolize the unconscious or emotional side of your life, you may feel you are failing there.

It\xe2\x80\x99s not so much about the lines on the diagram but rather the empty space that we should focus on. There are many astral planes that are layered on top of one another like a layered shingle of a roof top. Negative space is that which can\xe2\x80\x99t be touched or perceived, we can never truly understand it. Negative space is the human mind. The air elemental plays a significant role in moving between the planes of existence. You can somehow use the circle of life to access personal transmutation and the air elemental is also significant in this process. Death and rebirth are heavily related to the existential planes. \n\nOther notable things he said: \n\n\xe2\x80\x9c666 is a facade, 999 is the true power\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cEuripides\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\n\xe2\x80\x9cCallippides\xe2\x80\x9d. \n\nMake of that what you will.'

I practice forms of occultism regularly and I feel pretty in tune with the other planes of existence. \n\nAbout 4 months ago, July 2021, I took a nap in my bedroom after work. This was pretty typical for me. Nothing felt off that day, although I can\xe2\x80\x99t remember the exact day. When I woke up from my nap, for a brief few seconds I saw a man standing over me, looking at me. I will try to describe him below. \n\nHe was about 5\xe2\x80\x998\xe2\x80\x9d or 5\xe2\x80\x999\xe2\x80\x9d, white male with reddish-brown curly hair put up into a bun like thing with a bandana wrapped around where his hairline was. He did not have freckles. I believe his eyebrows were brown in color, a bit mismatched from his hair color. He was wearing what I think was a green tank top and khaki work-type pants which were baggy on his thin to medium frame. He was a bit lanky in build but not a total toothpick. He was wearing a large black backpack on his back and possibly a walking cane? He definitely gave me the impression he was a hitchhiker/nomad of some type. I only saw him for a fraction of a second before he disappeared but I was not having a dream during that nap. Nothing was said, he just stood there for a second before disappearing. I believe myself to be awake when this occurred. I don\xe2\x80\x99t experience sleep paralysis and I was not during this event. \n\nA few days later, I had a nightmare of a Latino man standing in the corner of my room. This time I was fully asleep unlike the previous in which I was awake. This man looked very evil, he had short brown hair, roughly 6\xe2\x80\x990\xe2\x80\x9d-6\xe2\x80\x992\xe2\x80\x9d, can\xe2\x80\x99t remember what he was wearing as it was focused on his face. He stared at me from around the corner of my dresser. Somehow he was within the dresser yet behind it. He had very intense dark black hair and eyebrows with evil looking tense brown eyes. His hair was short, almost like an overgrown buzz cut. He furrowed his brow and just stared at me until I woke up into a panic attack. \n\nCan someone please explain what the hell this was about? Can anyone find information on any missing persons/dead persons who match these descriptions? I\xe2\x80\x99m still a bit freaked out because if I try I can still \xe2\x80\x9csee\xe2\x80\x9d both of them in my head. They were both very vivid experiences.

This can come in the form of verbal reassurance or physical actions taken. This may seem temporarily gratifying to the individual who is experiencing anxiety or negative emotions. In the long run, however, it perpetuates feelings of not being able to trust your own judgment and the need for reassurance may become more and more intense or frequent.

I didn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep all that well but basically I was living with some roommates I didn\xe2\x80\x99t recognize as someone in real life in this dream. Takes place in a childhood home I don\xe2\x80\x99t live in anymore for relevancy. We were having a casual conversation outside while we were watching I think some little kid on Valentine\xe2\x80\x99s Day in the dream? Well there was roses I was holding that my grandpa had given me at some point during the dream while we were talking. Anyway this person was a male (medium build, brown semi-bowl cut hair, shorter than me by a little, had this smug looking face) and he just kept criticizing everything I said or did. Like I went to put the flowers in the compost area cause they were wilting along with some trimmed off hair I guess. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember exactly what this guy said but it was rude and I remember saying something like, \xe2\x80\x9cOh yea, that\xe2\x80\x99s a fair point but I leave the hair for the birds to nest with!\xe2\x80\x9d It seemed like even though he was criticizing me at first I was trying to maintain a peaceful encounter for the sake of living together. But eventually I got sick of his constant criticism and so I went off of him and basically said, \xe2\x80\x9cLook I know it\xe2\x80\x99s hard for you to give a shit about anyone other than yourself but I\xe2\x80\x99m really tired of you constantly shitting on everything I do or say. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t cost you anything to take 4 minutes out of your day to be nice to me.

He looked stunned like no one had ever said that shit to him and I stormed off irritated and annoyed throwing the rest of my flowers I had on the ground. Pretty sure that\xe2\x80\x99s when I woke up. For even more context, I am not a shy person in waking life. I can be confrontational when need be and I don\xe2\x80\x99t mind standing up for myself or others so it seems odd to me to have a dream about this?' "

My grandmother died in 2013 from aggressive breast cancer that spread through her whole body and I did witness her basically dying. I was young when this happened but old enough to remember it. \nAnyways, let\xe2\x80\x99s cut to the dream world. It was taking place in the house she died in. I was sitting on our living room floor with my grandfather (still alive irl) and watching television. I was facing a dark hallway that\xe2\x80\x99s actually there in the real house. I suddenly see someone come out of the bathroom and cross over to their bedroom. I say \xe2\x80\x9cNana?\xe2\x80\x9d and she turns and looks at me. (During this dream I am aware that she should not be alive still). She\xe2\x80\x99s in a night gown, maybe a pink one, and looks like herself but gaunt and pale. I don\xe2\x80\x99t remember exact details here but she\xe2\x80\x99s going on about how \xe2\x80\x9cshe\xe2\x80\x99s going to die soon anyway\xe2\x80\x9d but that they were wrong when they thought she was dead and that she had a little more time left. So she starts walking into the living room in front of me and trips and falls onto the rug on the floor. I yell, \xe2\x80\x9cNana!\xe2\x80\x9d and go to help her up. I scoop her up in my arms like a baby and am holding her near my face sort of. Up close she looks way aged beyond her years, leathery, and extremely gaunt and emaciated. She seems annoyed with still being alive. But I tell her \xe2\x80\x9cI love you\xe2\x80\x9d and start crying. She says \xe2\x80\x9cI love you, too\xe2\x80\x9d and I just continue to cry while holding her. Then out of nowhere there\xe2\x80\x99s suddenly a fireplace at the foot of where we\xe2\x80\x99re sitting and I start smelling something weird. It takes me a few minutes to realize we\xe2\x80\x99re both on fire but mostly me. My grandma got put out pretty quickly. I am rolling around panicking, on fire, and I embarrassingly had to strip off my pants in front of everyone in this dream. Then I think I got it out but I woke up right about then choking and coughing in real life. Help?' "

Like I haven\xe2\x80\x99t had one since then even come close to how horrific and traumatic that panic attack was. Until 2 days ago. I had the exact adrenaline rush, no trigger type panic attack while out driving. Previously, it would\xe2\x80\x99ve kept me inside for who knows how long or I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been able to move on. In 2020, after that panic attack I avoided the area it happened in for 6+ months and could barely go 5 minutes to the gas station. But nope! I decided it was just a panic attack, did breathing exercises, talked to someone to distract me, pulled over, waited out the symptoms, and kept going. I desperately wanted to drive home (since I was already driving when it hit). But I decided my anxiety WOULD NOT stop me that day. So I went down my January 2020 panic trigger road right after my recent panic attack. I went and visited my family and stayed for 4 hours. And I was totally FINE. I did that and I am very proud of the progress!' "

Well I was raised by an anti-vaxxer and was also falling for the media scaring the daylights out of me reporting on all kinds of crazy and terrifying rare side effects. But against my anxiety, I spontaneously booked my appointment. As time drew closer, I became more and more anxious, CONVINCED I would be the special 0.1% with crazy side effects. Well, I get the shot and did the 15 minute waiting period. Nothing. Maybe a small twinge of pain from getting a shot but nothing happened. I continued being anxious for the rest of the night. Woke up still kicking and totally fine. Still nothing. I had a slight sore arm for a few hours and the mildest leg aches of any illness I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever had. Seriously a regular cold is FAR worse than the shot. Anyways what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is, we get so caught up in our anxiety but we neglect that we aren\xe2\x80\x99t as special as we think. We are more likely to be the 99.9% that is fine than the 0.1% or 0.0005% that isn\xe2\x80\x99t. I am a week out from my first dose and absolutely NOTHING horrible has happened to me like I assumed would. And I am a very unhealthy at risk person. So if I can do it and am fine, you will be okay!'

I was a long hauler and had pretty devastating long term effects including pulmonary and cardiac symptoms. \n\nPreparation Taken: I hydrated extra the night before the vaccine and the day of. Electrolyte drinks and water were consumed, including a drink containing 90mg of Vitamin C. I avoided Tylenol and other pain medication the day of the vaccine. I considered taking Magnesium to avoid muscle pain but did not end up doing so. I have heard Magnesium has good success in preventing arm pain post-injection. I ate a meal a few hours before inoculation. \n\nDay 0, 6:30PM: I got Pfizer. Was administered around 6:30PM on 6/4/21. Before the shot I was totally freaking myself out as I\xe2\x80\x99m a diagnosed Hypochondriac. So I was very hyper aware of everything happening. Upon injection, I heard/felt a splashing or whooshing sound as the vaccine entered my arm and subsequently my muscle. The actual needle did not hurt much, much less painful than Tetanus or Meningitis vaccines I\xe2\x80\x99ve had in the past. Immediately after injection I felt slightly disoriented and dizzy but I was panicking pre-vaccine so I think that may just be my anxiety. A twinge of sore arm was felt immediately so I rotated my muscle around and the pain subsided. On the car ride home, I felt a twinge of a headache start, no worse than my typical ice pick headaches I normally get. It passed within less than 5 minutes. \n\nDay 0, 7:30 PM: Slight soreness of arm, mild muscle twitching in area (I also have Benign Fasciculation Syndrome so twitches are a common and daily occurrence for me), no other notable symptoms, anxiety has passed. \n\nDay 0, 8:30-10:00PM: Fatigue is definitely setting in, still only mild soreness in arm, mild aches in legs. I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel it\xe2\x80\x99s enough to even take medication for yet. I feel a bit out of it like when you first wake up in the morning, really want to take a nap but am able to function with a little extra effort. I also worked a morning shift today so I was already tired after work before I received the vaccine. \n\nDay0/1, 01:00-02:00AM (7-8 hours post-vaccine): Took a nap for a few hours, woke up not tired/fatigued anymore. I feel mostly back to normal. Still no fever. Arm soreness is more intense now, pain of mild to medium intensity if I lift arm past shoulder height or if I touch the muscle injection site. No other symptoms than mild headache for a few minutes and maybe a hint of aching pain in my legs. Still not bad enough to even take medicine for. Going to go to bed for the night soon to rest as much as possible. \n\nDay 1, 1:00PM (18 hours post-vaccine): Still totally unremarkable as far as other symptoms than a sore arm. Woke up with a slightly more stiff and sore arm today, massaged the muscle there, feels much better already. May take a Tylenol for the sore arm later in the day but it\xe2\x80\x99s nothing I can\xe2\x80\x99t handle. Feels like a big bruise or as if I\xe2\x80\x99ve been punched and it\xe2\x80\x99s sore. Slept last night without issue. \n\nDay 1, 6:00-7:00PM (24 hours post-vaccine): Arm was extremely sore and stiff earlier, since moving it around and using it more the pain is subsiding to very light soreness when I lift it up. Still no fever or other symptoms. Feeling a little fatigued but less so than yesterday. Still have not had to take any medication for pain. Studied for classes and went to the grocery store without any issue. \n\nDay 1/2, 03:00AM (Roughly 34 hours post-vaccine): Arm pain has almost entirely subsided except for tenderness if the injection site is pushed on. Still no other symptoms besides very light leg aching. Never developed a fever, intense headache, or other symptoms. \n\nDay 2, 11:30AM (41 hours post-vaccine): Woke up today with my sore arm almost absolutely gone. The soreness is very slight in the back of my arm now towards where the armpit and tricep join. It almost feels like a pimple that\xe2\x80\x99s sore now. The injection site is very mildly tender but has decreased a lot. Over the whole ordeal the only other symptom that *may* be related to the vaccine is generalized itching but I do have eczema and other skin conditions so I cannot confirm that the vaccine has directly caused this extra itching since I have not been keeping up with my daily moisture regimen for my eczema. I think I will update at 48 hours and leave it there unless I experience any late-onset symptoms. In which case I will edit to add them. \n\nDay 2, 6:00PM (48 hours post-vaccine): Felt mild fatigue after working a full shift, arm is basically totally painless again. Going to take a nap. Still never developed any crazy or weird symptoms. Body aches mostly subsided, maybe very mild and background leg aches but again, I worked all day with them without medication so it\xe2\x80\x99s not bad at all. \n\nDay 2, 12:00AM (65 hours post-vaccine): Arm pain totally gone, no other symptoms after waking up from nap. Feeling energetic and back to normal. I was concerned I would develop delayed symptoms but it never happened. \n\n\nTL;DR: Got my Pfizer shot even though I was freaking the heck out, developed a sore arm and a little fatigue but otherwise was totally fine. You should get your shot, it might not even be bad.' "

I\xe2\x80\x99m watching from third person I\xe2\x80\x99m not actually present in the room but I\xe2\x80\x99m seeing everything happening. There\xe2\x80\x99s a little girl in a hot pink onesie. She seems to be about 3-5 years old. She is sitting in front of the TV watching something. The man is sitting on the floor behind her. The woman is across the room smoking on a different couch. As I am watching the man and little girl, he comes up behind her, and grabs her from behind. He places her between his legs and starts molesting her. It got pretty graphic at times, like using his fingers to do awful things. The little girl was very distressed and upset and trying to get away from the man. I am getting furious but since I am not present I cannot do anything to stop this. As I continue to watch this child being molested, it takes every bit of rage in me and I start spitting blood at the couch where the mother is repeatedly. It felt like I was trying to show my disgust for the mother not taking any action to stop the pedophile father. I kept having to use all of my energy to spit blood all over this tan couch. Any ideas what the heck this means? It was really disturbing to see child sex abuse right in front of me.' "

Last night I had a dream that I was at the doctor\xe2\x80\x99s and they took some blood testing from me (This does happen frequently in waking life to me, I\xe2\x80\x99m also pursuing a career in phlebotomy too). When I got the results then it became apparent it was a hormone panel for me. The results were I had low estrogen and high testosterone. I remember asking the doctor about taking medication to fix it. I am assigned female in real life. Any ideas of significance?' "

Well I finally had one. A nightmare. I was in my bathroom at my grandpa's when I used to live with him. And I was using a hair dryer to do my hair. Well when I unplugged it the outlet sparked and started a mini electrical fire. It wasn't so bad and I used a wet cloth to pat it out. I left the room and came back and it was on fire again. Nothing huge, it was pretty contained to the outlet. Basically I spent this whole dream trying to put out this tiny electrical fire and I went to get my grandpa but he just kept telling me it was fine and not to worry. Ideas? It could mean nothing bc I was watching a documentary about arson before bed and also my actual hair dryer in waking life is smelling burnt and acting weird."" "

eRisk2023-T3_Subject43, b'PLEASE HELP WITH THIS DREAM I AM SO FREAKED OUT' , b'2020-06-09 10:50:30' , reddit post ," b'so the setting is my grandpa\'s house in his kitchen (we used to live here when i was young so it makes sense). myself, my stepdad, my mom, and my boyfriend are present. my mom is cooking dinner. we were having asparagus, zucchini (or squash), and some type of meat. my stepdad is already off to the living room watching tv and eating his plate. as my mom was setting the table in a separate room (dining room), she was asking why no one got the meat she cooked. my boyfriend and i explained that we had thought it was sausage and she had said that it was something else. so i went and tried a bit and it was really good. i was nibbling on the asparagus as she was setting the table. as she\'s walking back in, all of a sudden i see a shape out of the corner of my eye. as i look over i see an emaciated, scrawny, and lanky man in a diaper pulling a ceiling tile out of the way and jumping down through the ceiling. he hangs onto the metal beams in between tiles for a second then drops down onto our kitchen table (not the dining room table my mom was setting). when he drops down i realize he\'s not a man but rather a little boy. at first he looks pale. my mom and boyfriend see how thin he is and say ""oh my gosh are you okay? you must be hungry"" and they hurry to the pantry to grab him some food. as they\'re off doing that, i approach him to talk. when i get up close i realize he\'s not actually pale and has white face paint on. he has a picture in his hand. i ask him who he is and where he came from. he says ""i came from my brother"" and hands me the photo. the photo is a picture of my actual waking life little cousin who passed away from leukemia when he was 8. i asked him ""what do you mean? are you sure?"" and he replies with a look on his face that implies he felt bad for lying ""actually i AM my brother"". then i wake up. the kid in the dream looked identical to my best friend\'s autistic little brother.'

Well I was getting into bed last night and I looked at the frame and had this awful deja vu feeling come over me. And then I realized I had seen this before in a dream a few weeks ago before I knew this bed existed and way before my birthday. I had dreamed that I was watching myself dream and that I had died in my sleep on this bed shortly after my birthday and that my fiance was trying to revive me doing CPR and crying his eyes out.
