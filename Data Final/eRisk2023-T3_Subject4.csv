""Designer sunnies"" for example, unrecyclable plastic lenses that cost them 50p to produce and sell for \xc2\xa3400. They spend resources to freight them to an Amazon warehouse. Customer buys them and doesn\'t like them. Van takes them back to warehouse. Amazon bundles them up into a box of general crap that people didn\'t want, like or need and sells them again. Van takes them to new customer in assumedly an insane amount of Amazon style packaging. Whereupon the new customer packages them up again, and send them in a van to another customer paying another e-commerce platform 12% for the privilege.\n\n1. That is the most inefficient way of providing a resource to a resource user.\n2. The intrinsic value of the resource is in no way reflected in the cost imposed on the user.\n3. The environmental aspect of the operation is horrendous.\n4.

You'll want to focus on spinach (frozen is best if you don't like the taste, you can microwave it and mix it into anything for a bit of fibre and vitamins), broccoli, cauliflower is great because it's pretty much just water, Brussel sprouts and asparagus with butter and bacon (I'm getting hungry thinking about it).
