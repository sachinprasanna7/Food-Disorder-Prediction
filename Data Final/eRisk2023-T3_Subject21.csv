(idk how exact the 30 seconds are)\n\nUltimately the file (when you do the subsampling sampling) is arbitrary but you do need to make sure your input has the same time between steps. \n\nI say this because I've also seen approaches where full spectograms are treated as images (which might need to be resized if not all data is the same length) which people then use a convnet with and I would guess deformation from resizing would have a negative effect on your model for this particular usecase.""

Still relatively limited (with domain limited by links on pages themselves, rather than direct url query, but with lots of room to expand, given the ubiquity of software) and prompt driven (but I would say people underestimate how they themselves are also very much prompt-driven and with planning coming into the picture following external commands becoming a smaller ratio of it\'s set of behavior).\n\nI\'d say the most serious lack w.r.t. sentience is response adjustment out of training phase although this seems more an engineering challenge than an ANN challenge (when do you accept that the environment tells you that you\'re incorrect and should adjust: not always sometimes it\'s a fluke and sometimes the person telling you you\'re wring is actually the one making the mistake, not to speak of malicious actors). \n\nIt is also considered a proverb that ""insanity is doing the same thing twice and expecting different results"", yet many people do not adjust their actions. As such I\'m not sure this should be a requirement for sentience unless you\'d want to exclude people ad I\'m not sure this response adjustment out of training phase is something people in general are good at either.'

However, I worry this might be quite slow to learn as a logistic unit has a tendency to produce mostly close to 1 and close to 0 values.\n\nAs such I am wondering whether there might be a better way to adjust for this, or a different way to force output values to be between 0 and 1 in a uniform fashion such that this issue doe snot arise at all.\n\nAny thoughts are much appreciated.  \n\n\nEdit: I did some more thinking and have come to a solution: instead of using the logistic output directly, I put that value into the logistics comulative distribution function and the result should be uniformly distributed, which I can then put in my other functions inverse cumulative distribution function, thanks for rubber ducking everyone.'

However, I\'m currently a bit stuck on the distribution to use.\n\nIn this data, there is both variation in the **source** emission of potential hitters w.r.t. whether they make the cut and how long they do so (and continue ""hitting""). I interpret this as being either a Poisson or a Weibull distribution depending on assumption, as well as variation in the amount of possible **targets** which can be assumed to have an unknown but constant growth rate, which violates a basic assumption for many distributions/estimation (data being i.i.d.)\n\nFor simplicity\'s sake you can think of it as a binomial distribution B(n, p), where the number of successes is available, but the total number attempts is not and where the amount of attempts is growing over time. For the binomial case I would reformulate the standard distribution as B(n^(time * growth rate), p) and use an expectation maximization process to find the growth rate. The data, however, isn\'t binomial.\n\nAnother way to view this is the amount of busses arriving, but the data you have obtained is over a period where the government has been slowly, but steadily increasing spending for public transport, resulting in more busses being on the road.\n\nHowever, with the Poisson distribution scaling this distribution\'s rate parameter seems to create a mismatch in shape of distribution and outcomes, which makes me think it really is not appropriate.\n\nThis makes me favor the Weibull by intuition because scale and shape are separated, yet the data I have is count based with 0s among them, and I\'m not sure how to model that appropriately when assuming a Weibull distribution.

It also seems that is not really getting you anywhere (3 years is quite the long-run experiment), so eh, have you tried not doing that and instead trying to look for a hobby you enjoy? **I don\'t mean deciding on something and then being disappointed you don\'t enjoy it, but trying out 10 things for a month each and deciding afterwards**, that is something which has taken me 7 depressive episodes to figure out.\n\n4. IQ is a measurement of ability to pick up patterns on the fly, and picking up patterns on the fly is what causes people to perform well at new/complex tasks. Instead of worrying about IQ worry about which patterns you are missing which might help you and research those, there\'s plenty of info out there which you can use to make up for lack of ability to pick things up on the fly.\n\n5. Internet people are by my estimation not very good at planning (who ever plans to spend N amount of time in an associated time block on twitter/reddit/insta/discord). Planning is associated with valuation/prioritisation/ordering, which means you probably also suck at that, as do I, so instead of reading all these comments one by one as they come in and hoping something sticks, come back to this post in a week, sit down to read all of the comments, write down whatever speaks to you and then select **ONE (1)** thing to try out, then set multiple reminders for yourself (so you don\'t decide to just ignore them) to repeat this every 3 months.\n\n6. More of an actual attack to maybe get you to actually do something else; if you\'re low IQ and all you keep worrying about is IQ, that\'s *really pretty dumb*. You say you care about being smart so the least you should to is try to emulate what a smart person would do, and I do not mean IQ smart, I mean gets-the-things-they-want-out-of-life smart. A smart person doesn\'t get stuck worrying about how they\'re not X, they either figure out a way to become X or figure out they should pursue an alternative goal to X or figure out X is just a substitute for Y and they can actually use Z to reach Y. Either re-evaluate the values you think you have or start acting like you actually have them.\n\nGood luck.' "

As someone who has been in a repeated battle with depression this rings particularly true to me, and it is the way I patch myself up once I have a story to tell myself again, which is quite the issue on its own.\n\nIt is generally known that conscientiousness increases (on average) with age. one way to interpret this, is that it is something that ""just happens"". Another is that as people progress in their lives they might get thrown new responsibilities to take care of, which forces them to adapt their behavior to keep up or give up, where the latter is not always feasible (in case of not being able to afford or want getting fired, or having to take care of children). it doesn\'t mean everyone will do this, but such situations provide an impetus which can make this happen.\n\nif-then rules; I forgot how I came across the paper, but I\'ve recently read a bunch of papers on behavior/personality change [one](http://kops.uni-konstanz.de/bitstream/handle/123456789/10253/97GollBrand_ImpIntGoalPurs.pdf?sequence=1andisAllowed=y) [two](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2015-13967-001) [three](https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.2017548118), out of which the bottom line seems to be thinking up if-then rules helps the formation of habits because it removes the otherwise necessary moment-to-moment decision making process making it easier to actually do things vs just wanting to do things without a clear how.\n\nI\'m incredibly bad at policing myself (and an incredible sucker for novelty vs.. sticking to a plan) if I consciously try to do it, but these are things I notice have an effect on me.\n\nComing back to the story issue - the ""who am I and why am I even doing this?"" - For me it\'s quite difficult to maintain a consistent interest in stories, so much so that I can spend 2 months reading the Deep Work book ([podcast section core idea](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJYlhhT7hyE)) from Cal Newport, implement a bunch of things form it, and then fall back a bunch of steps because my mind becomes preoccupied with different things.\n\nThe main Issue, I think I at least face, is that if things do not work out the way you think, and that thinking was connect to a story, then the story weakens in influence because you discover it isn\'t as good a story as you thought it was. But if the story was the thing pushing you forward you now have less of a push overall resulting in a downward spiral. One way to remedy this is by replacing the story with peoples feedback, but this is only as productive as the people around you are helpful or desirable to emulate. Another is taking up a religion earnestly, since the \'solution\' to experiencing problems is asking god for help and guidance, rather than dropping the religion outright, but this is easier said than done.\n\nI don\'t know you, so I have no idea to what extend your low conscientiousness claim about yourself is actually true, versus being self-critical. (you put in the effort to paragraph and bullet-point your post for example, so it can\'t be bottomless-pit low at least), but regardless I would think it\'s a bad idea to conceptualize yourself as low conscientiousness instead of as someone who has not learned to act conscientiously effectively, and that that is something worth learning so you can execute corresponding behavior when ""just acting conscientiously"" *is* the lazy solution (e.g. when doing a repetitive task).'

If there is little aesthetic, which might have seduced people into the movement, then there is less dispersion of interest from the foundations among people who have joined the movement.\n\nTo give an example: As a university student I have seen quite some people who clamored about their socialist, communist or anarchist beliefs; while contributing little to such groups besides joining parties. At the same time I know a few effective altruists, who were almost all very much involved in organising public lectures, meetups, starting companies even. All had very bland style, as opposed to the other group (with the most style-conscious person among EA's being least involved in making things/organisation).\n\nI do admit there might be a bias in self-proclamation here - who would call themselves an effective altruist publicly if they're not actually being effective?\n\nJust because you as a writer feel not as compelled to join because of an aesthetic lack does not mean it is not doing its job; low aesthetic might be a filter for people who look at the bottom line, rather than intermediate aspects/substitute goals. Art/aesthetics becomes important for movements if their goals are to gain adherents and come to rule through social expectations. It seems to me the EA have less of a desire for ruling (since it requires time spent doing non-goal activities, is slow/inefficient and unnecessary for many goals) since it cares less about other people doing things in particular ways than it cares about them being able to do things at all.\n\nEven as a symmetric weapon analogy it does not work; EA and related groups are not in conflict for adherents, they acknowledge that although there are issues that are Incredibly Important, they also acknowledge that there are many such issues which are not even known yet, and discovering unknown unknown systemic risk is one of their directions of interest. As such, the least amount of aesthetic might well be a coordination point since it signifies the group which is actually doing it for the goals they profess, rather than a secondary goal. \n\nAt the same time, EA's low focus on aesthetics has a similar thing going as minimalism, which although not calling for followers somehow seems to get them, and what is the purpose in telling minimalists to not be minimalist if it seems to work for them?\n\nThe counterpoint about it's communication style is pretty strong, so much so that I recognize a similar appreciation when I read some pieces, e.g. from SSC/ACX/Gwern as when I do a novel with particular style; clear writing, with elaborations and interesting details, but without them ever feeling like they have been written for their own sake, flowing naturally through the text as if they belong.\n\nIf an aesthetic truly is necessary and people are looking for one; [Terrapunk](https://nasjaq.substack.com/p/the-terrapunk-manifesto) aligns closest I think\n\nEdit: an example of such small textual additions is in the tagline of ACX:\n> P(A|B) = [P(A)*P(B|A)]/P(B), all the rest is commentary.\n\nIf all the rest is commentary, then why bother writing that? - It looks nice, and makes for a more interesting read; just because it is commentary does not mean it is of no value. I think this captures the aesthetic pretty well, but I wouldn't know how to translate it to imagery."" "

Just like km/hour isn\'t a property but a measure, so is in my view consciousness. It has no purpose unless it is being used for some purpose, like how it is pretty difficult to increase the speed of a car without a measure of speed.\n\nEdit: one could even put the concept of ""consciousness-expanding"" drugs under this framework, insofar as they initially cause the drug-taker to post-use/effect deliberate making changes in their life which have effect outside the context of drug-use.'

Since the start of bitcoin people have tried to make other things, from attaching a meme (doge, shiba, spankchain) to it, making it about storage (filecoin, arweave) or privacy (monero, zcash), to arbitrary computation (ethereum (bound by gas limit, but still)), more efficient forms to accomplish that through different mechanisms (algorand, solana, binance, polygon, hedera), oracles (chainlink, iexec), arbitration/escrow/subjective oracles (kleros, taskbar, aragon, paid, uma) with every category containing many more than listed here and most of which being grifts and containing just a few legitimate projects. I think ICOs/crypto, starting from bitcoin have lowered the bar of entry for obtaining funding, at least for the subset of people more familiar with programming than with commercial law/VC/grant-making which is obviously going to include scammers.\n\nIt's not clear these the use cases require crypto at all though; fiverr, patreon and gofundme work relatively well (with exception of sanctioned countries, individuals and individuals that work in porn (-adjacent) industries), but I see them more as an expansion if programming libraries/github repositories than anything else: most are not used by anyone besides the maker, but a subset of them carries entire networks (or even academic fields) on its shoulders.\n\nI'm relatively certain the final crypto datastructure is not blockchain (bitcoin) in it's current form though; there's only a certain percentage of people in the world with the required amount of tunnel vision for that to happen; still, blockchain/bitcoin as an idea no doubt influenced the creation of these things.\n\nFurther, about oracles,\n\n>As soon as an oracle is involved it has such control, via controlling the facts your program knows, of such a large portion of your system that you may as well make it the central part and just leave the blockchain bit out altogether. You have found a trusted third party.\n\nI agree with this, but think that for such an oracle to be created it was required that the creation of non-entity-money-contracts/holders (NEMCH) would be easier. Oracles mostly function as the resolution source for these NEMCH, which is especially undoable with AML/KYC regulations because those require a person to be at the other end or at least a lot of paperwork, but this is enabled by smart contracts which anyone can create (while at the time functioning outside legal frameworks).\n\nIf bitcoin will be worth anything in a century I think most of it's value will be derived of its nature as a cultural artifact as the kickstart of this direction.\n\nlastly I'm curious about the inflation claim; Although not bitcoin, I've seen quite a few talks about DAI/tether being used for this in latin america (although I'm a european and have no clue about the actual validity of these claims), and bitcoin is just one of many options at this point; might do some analysis with google trends later, if I find time for that at some point.""

Review is something which will be done anyway, if people actually read the papers they work with, and the problem that the process of peer review solves is not whether the reviewing gets done, but that this process was difficult to do because papers would or would not be included in journal editions.\n\nOnly a couple experts, if they are interested in it, need to review it and if it is in their field would do so anyway. before the problem was figuring out what was in their field, which was solved by this curation, whereas now this is a as simple as clicking ""cited by"" on google scholar for a few of their own papers.'

Although money is made by correctly assessing people's reactions, that is something you actually don't want to have to care about because it is way too complex.\n\nFutures markets started as insurance for rice, such that farmers and merchants could remove risk from their business by making trades isolated from future events, while transfering both risk and extra ROI (and potential losses) to third parties who wanted to take those on.

It causes there to be a link between doing work now and getting rewarded for it later, contrasted with a personal sense of ""helplessness""/worthlessness when just only ordering takeout or eating frozen meals bought from the supermarket.\n\nfor freezer size: I\'d advice to get as large as would reasonable fit, better to have too much room than too little, you can get a second hand one for much cheaper than at the store, and its pretty easy to test whether they work :\'). I take very little care of my fridge and freezer (i.e. turning them off and cleaning them with all-purpose cleaner when I possibly have some energy to fix things during summer; once a year) and they just continue to work, so even though I cannot remove your worries about it I can atleast anecdotally vouch for it most likely being fine even if you don\'t take care of it well.\n\nI\'ve got other things which\'ve also helped, especially during my episode this last year (in the sense of starting to recover emotionally while my situation still is pretty shit) but I figured I\'d keep it focussed on mealprepping for now, feel free to ask or dm and otherwise good luck!'

Although both require production of non-noise data, with images you can get a long way by enforcing local coherence, whereas with music longer term coherence is what makes it impressive, be it in lyrical coherence over time, or continuing to stick to a certain pitch and set of rythems, which is something openAI jukebox has issues with. In fact, the local coherence is achieved in the sense that pieces have distinct feels to them, but the bigger picture is less coherent.\n\nat the same time, models like dall-e can produce pictures of things which do not exist or are nonsensical and we don\'t bat an eye, so maybe the image domain is also more forgiving than the music domain w.r.t. judgement, and the lack of ""good models"" has more to do with our difference in judgement by modality rather than models\' capabilities.'

Since costs are priced in dollars, this rise is slow enabling a long runway for network effects to accumulate, enabling more use cases and cost decreases which is the value premium of having hbars.\n\nhbars are limited, and although transactions are priced in dollars, hbars are still needed for transactions, and thus necessary to use the (most efficient network).\n\nthe value premium of an hbar is determined by how much can be gained, relatively to using a different solution/network. The price is determined through a speculation on what this value premium will be in the future, combined with expected ROI from staking over time.\n\njust because it's all in terms of hbars isn't as weird as it sounds though; imagine you're playing a videogame and trying to value a rare boss-monster weapon drop. How much it is worth depends on how much it improves ROI of using that vs using something different in your weapon slot when fighting boss monsters for loot. If it is the best weapon in the game with the lowest drop rate you bet your ass it's going to be worth a lot as in essence it's something which contributes to getting more of those best weapons (as well as other loot which can be sold to buy the best weapon in the game), whereas other, older weapons will loose value.\n\nThis is a common problem in games where old content slowly becomes dead content as updates continue to introduce new weapons, leading old weapons to upon specs of the new weapon being discovered to first crash and then end up at or below store-price or, if there is a gold-conversion spell in the game, around that price.\n\nMaking it a weapons with a single slot is not entirely accurate though, as this misses the aspect of the benefit of network effects, whereby different things with the same kind of function can continue to be used, by virtue of enabling different technology stacks; you generally have a best weapon for each of the different combat styles (medieval, melee, range, mage; or modern, knife, sniper, rocket launcher).\n\npeople can decide they just like a different weapon, but ultimately the people who use the best weapon gain the highest ROI and as a result have an easier time buying other items too, and since as a ledger base layer hedera is basically a best weapon candidate it's where a lot of the value will end up if it turns out to indeed be a best weapon and its network continues to expand.""

This is done through titles and pictures for reddit, and entire tweets on twitter, which people can click/""decompress"" titles into post content and responses-approximately-sorted-by-upvotes if deemed interesting enough, rather than having to go through *everything* linearly in long form - can you imagine it being that way?\n\nYou don\'t open every post on reddit, nobody does, because not all parts are as interesting as all the other parts. Story books on the other hand require the full earlier context, you miss lots of story elements if you only read the chapters which have interesting titles and it becomes a pain to read if you continually get distracted while reading because you end up reading the same thing over and over again.\n\nConcluding apps like reddit just condition you to expect mroe reward from reading than a typical book might give; find a book you want to read, quit reddit/feed-based apps and websites for, say, a week and then read the book.

I\'m currently however confronted with a task/project which I feel is useless and even finishing it would not be an achievement in my own eyes (anyone can tell me it is, but so far none of it has been convincing to me).\n\nas such, I find myself completely unable to do ANYTHING at all anymore. even my ability to make breakfast can be impacted on days, because my impulse to make breakfast used to be guided by wanting to be at places where I worked; but now I don\'t want to, and there\'s no consequences if I work from home, so it\'s an option that nothing gets done.\n\nPlanning and then executing said plans is helping me a lot, in part to get the things done and in part because it brings me something to value, becoming better in planning and executing plans itself, where I feel progress is usefull. \n\nIf you make a planning, which is detailed enough that you only have to follow it without making decisions along the way, and situate yourself that following the planning is the easiest thing to do it is much easier to get the things done, than when you\'re constantly assessing use/priority.  Something to consider is that once your execitive function starts to rely on willpower (or more accurately, strength to actively divert attention to tasks which do not feel inherently rewarding, such as writing this comment - I really should be eating my breakfast), it becomes much more limited because you\'ve only got so much of it.\n\nIf you\'re, like me, not used to it here is a warning not to get your hopes up too high: shit takes **way long** to learn, so don\'t beat yourself up if it doesn\'t start working immedietly, the point is the learning of it.\n\n**Also : vitamins and minerals**, when I have ""crash-days"" I (used to) eat junkfood, which had a cascading effect on following days by lack of energy. that seemed to start changing once I started taking some of the supplements listed on scott\'s [depression page](https://lorienpsych.com/2021/06/05/depression/) noteably iron, b12 and methyl-folate, all in metabolically available form; since I started taking these my crash-days have turned into crash-halfdays, and crash-halfdays into crash-hours. Might be placebo, or just a daily functional reminder that I\'m trying to improve things which has an effect on it\'s own, but it\'s worth a shot.\n\nLastly, I recommend reading **and finishing** Bernand Kastrups\' ""Science Ideated: The Fall Of Matter And The Contours Of The Next Mainstream Scientific Worldview"". I find the writing absolutely horrible, and the content very dubious, but it has been material in becoming better able to take notice of my own behaviour through the way the book lays an emphasis on qualitative experience.

Different school levels, school to work, etc. Where people suddenly face a lot more expectations (which their previous experience might not necessarily prepare them for) from others and at the same time might come to realise Rosey pictures which were painted do not quite fit reality. Contrast school to work with slowly building up a craft/profession through helping parents or relatives to ultimately help them run their business, taking up responsibility as one grows.\n\nLonely people are everywhere, but it are the ""well off"" countries where they get hit by reality \n(or rather, the contrast between reality and their own expectations) the hardest if they stray off the externally expected path.\n\nThis would pull the solution closer towards making sure expectations line up with reality, which might mean limits on advertising (as not to let seem life more beautiful than it might be, both TV advertising as well as for example the overstatements on how much a certain education might benefit life prospects), more responsibilities for everyone in the sense of community service (and thus experience building as to not fall behind). As well as making the rock-bottom level higher as decrease contrast in that way.\n\nAll of these approach require a lot of bureaucracy though so in the end those might just end up changing in more hoops to jump through.\n\nA more practical approach would be, from a personal action standpoint, to be more realistic and encourage this in others to safeguard the communities we live in.'

That, though, might exactly be the point as such an idea could only be attached to something which does not have qualitative value (positive or negative) of it\'s to which distracts from this concept. take for example every crypto that unlike bitcoin have direct utility for some application. \n\nAlmost any purchaser of these does their purchase out of a belief to invest in an idea/application which they think have a revolutionary value, or to make a quick buck. The mentality of ""the money is broken"" is an idea which can only stick for objects which have nothing except the denominator:money, for if the denominator was broken you would be looking at other assets, in other denominated currency.\n\nAs such I think it\'s self selection bias for the subject. Consider also the dislike of strong state power in some crypto circles. Why do they dislike it? because they think, rightly or wrongly but for some reason, that the system of value/responsibility is broken. If they come into crypto through this gold-view they have decided states are posturing but inadequate to make up for this presented cost to living by ""the system"". The reason Bitcoin/other non-specific-utility crypto are the ones which spread this message is that it is the group with the most exclusive focus on their denominator, a ledger entry which may not even shine.\n\nEdit: apparently it\'s pretty clearly directed to crypto, as evidenced towards the quote and link at the bottom, wrote this response from memory of the page.

eRisk2023-T3_Subject21, b'Consciousness and Experience; Depression and Adjectives.' , b'2022-05-13 12:38:35' , reddit post ," b'I\'ve recently been reading a book on consciousness^(1) . So far it has been about the question of what consciousness is. A recurrent component of his dismissal of arguments against consciousness (in the sense that consciousness would be an illusion, or an abstraction of functional states) is that the experiential component of it is undeniable. A possible example of this is that *trees are not green, but reflect photons of a certain wavelength, which our brains proceed to convert to the perception of the color green*.\n\nNow consider a person who experiences life such that ""***The sun still shines, the birds still chirp, but the trees are no longer green""*** And compare it with another ""***The sun still shines brightly, the birds still sing, but the trees have lost their colour***"". The first subsentence has a redundant adjective added from the point of view of the sun: brightly. The same goes for the replacement of chirp and sing in case of the birds, the sentence mostly just changes how the perception should be valued for the listener, both of these have a noteably less depressed character than their former counterparts, whereas the 3rd subsentence has become more depressed as here not just the colour green, but the category of colour as a whole has disappeared.\n\nWhile reading this book I noticed I experienced a strong dislike of the degree of saturation of sentences with adjectives and adverbs because they felt ""pushy"" in a sense like an imperative to value things in specific ways along specific dimensions.\n\nAs such, since I am currently depressed(-or something, waiting lists...), I came to wonder whether there are any studies on the linguistics of depression, specifically the use of adjectives and adverbs. I havent\'t been able to find much though, probably due to lack of knowledge of the field specific jargon. Anything\'s welcome.\n\nEdit: Furthermore, coming back to the beginnign of the post, it seems to me that consciousness - not happiness - is the opposite of depression, as it is the state in which properties are perceived, rather than being in either an absent state of mind or in a state where you wish you were that.\n\nEdit 2: I\'m already aware of [https://lorienpsych.com/2021/06/05/depression/](https://lorienpsych.com/2021/06/05/depression/) , although I haven\'t had the energy to go through it fully.\n\n\\[1\\]  Bernardo Kastrups\' ""Science Ideated: The Fall Of Matter And The Contours Of The Next Mainstream Scientific Worldview""' "

eRisk2023-T3_Subject21, b'Not recognizing feeling lonely? what does it mean to be lonely?' , b'2022-05-08 14:51:02' , reddit post ," b""I'm recently dealing with a bunch of mental health issues among which depression (little desire for things, low energy, difficulty getting things done), the specifics of which are largely irrelvant and not fully diagnosed yet, however there are some themes which frequently occur in lists of what makes a more fulfilling life. taking one example of such lists is:\n\n- Craft,\n- Community,\n- Constitution,\n- Contemplation.\n\nAmong these I find that community is somewhat vague to me. I have friends I hang out with, yet I do not feel like that is something which I actually enjoy most of the time. I don't feel very connected with them and they're all over the place, which doesn't make it feel very cohesive or stable and one of my more closer friends expresses dislike for a lot of the others, which makes it difficult for me to bring people together.\n\nRecently, due to stress, I've cancelled a lot of appointments with people because I was just too busy and couldn't manage everything. However, I notice I really do not miss most of them, the majority actually costs me energy to hang out with and after having done so I am glad that I've fulfilled my social obligation and don't have to see them for at least 3-4 weeks to maintain the friendship. This reminded me of having said often that I hardly feel lonely and as such don't have much impulse to make appointments with people, which at the same time causes me to have difficulty maintaining friendships.\n\nComing back to community, I remember there being 3 periods in my life of about a year where I did feel community and actively sought out people to meet. I am wondering whether these things are related and whether I might actually be lonely, but not realise it as I just lack a frame of reference as to what my current feeling w.r.t. people should be contrasted with.\n\nSorry for the blogpost, I don't really know where else to put this but I would like to gather some thoughts on it.""

Currently you buy them and are stuck with them even if the meta changes and your champ (and thus possibly cosmetics) are not relevant anymore. you could argue it is the companies buisness model to do this but it has a cost: If people can resell their IGI, then the initial barrier to entry for buying becomes lower because if you don\'t like it, you can just resell it. \n\nThis, though, is already an option on the steam marketplace, without NFTs so apparently there is a different reason this is not common practice, possibly the overhead or possibly a lack of extra profits, because who would pay extra for a second-hand cosmetic item, right?. \n\nHowever if for each items there comes an NFT version and a non-NFT version you could add a record of all previous owners to each item, enabling players to buy the cosmetics that their favourite pro-players have used, or record match history to show off that every game they have played with a specific cosmetic they have won (and let vanity-rebuying of the cosmetics/NFTs bring in a profit margin). \n\nSimilarly facilitating a trade in limited edition cosmetics (where a small percentage cut is taken per trade) can bring in a new revenue stream because people will try to make money if the cut taken is small enough (0.1% or something).\n\nGaming companies really need to frame this thing better.'

We sort of take it for granted that intelligence gives us so many things, but most of the things which allow us to leverage - and thus allow gradient descent to progress in that direction - required intelligence to already have produced them. With AI this would now be less of a problem as since a lot of applications online are within reach.\n\nExamples are consensus about ownership, as it allows for planning besides protection of resources (where force outcompetes intelligence in most cases), and communication/cooperation protocols such that other agents can be leveraged for things that the agent itself can plan, but cannot accomplish on its own.\n\nBoth of these require pre-existence of intelligence in some way and empower intelligence endowed individuals disproportionately. Rather than bigger models I think most development will come from better ability to process unstructured or semi-structured data and a form of sovereignty to use external programs, and then NLP will get us/it quite far in the planning department - within known contexts.""

Not to jynx the ""they say they get it"", but I experience something similar in the sense of difficulty sequencing/prioritising (autism spectrum syndrome component (I should not be on reddit right now, sigh)), combined with a tendency to progcrastrinate (with larger side projects too (delay aversion as a component of adhd is a thing)). and I\'m pretty certain it is something similar as the solution you propose works for me as well, but is not always practical like you say.\n\nRE getting back on the treadmill: plan hours where you do things and do things then and just then.

(and make sure you have told them, preferably in writing).\n\n>I\xe2\x80\x99ve written about this during mental breakdowns or ""episodes,"" and the best I can divine from my own writing is that my personal priors for expecting my offerings to the system to pay off have become so low that I\xe2\x80\x99ve resorted to an emotional approach to productivity.\n\nThis too is very familiar to me, and for me has thus far only been fixed historically by: \n- Somehow convincing myself that the payoff is actually not as low \n- forcing the hours of work for productivity, placing planned hours as highest value judgement, rather than the normal way to approach valueing work on the grounds that it provides predictability and that that is what you need to get back on track.\n\nAlso, from your parable it sounds like you are stuck between making your company (even more of) a reality and the perils of your current employment. That\'s called having two jobs and it\'s rough. \n\nUnless you have a clear division of labor over time you are going to feel miserable because you\'re not spending your time on the work you ""should"" spend it on. Again: I have the same, my thesis and an AR side project. I had planned my AR project on weekends, but the learning-feedback period between sessions is too long so I will have to postpone it, and put something else, something smaller but still meaningfull in it\'s place untill I have full time available for it. \n\nIn the meantime: figure out if you can get extra funding/loans to get your buisness off the ground without having to work beside it; it\'s not uncommon to go essentially to the bank with a proposal on how to make money, evidence you\'re doing it and asking for a loan based on its returns, such that you actually have the means to build it up and eat at the same time.'

There was not much change in extraversion, openness and agreeableness, but there was a decrease in neurotiscism and increase in conscientiousness.\n\nAs a result (of that among many other things) I've recently (1.5 months) started to pay more attention to how I organise my life and I notice I'm becoming less anxious (from daily life activities, to my view on how the ukraine war will or will not influence the rest of the world). A bias I certainly have is being too distrustfull (and thus anxious when I am dependent on them for something) of things/institutions/people who are supposed to work/help, and this too seems to decrease (as long as I stick to what I had planned, and am not typing reddit posts like this when I should be gettign ready for work, sigh).\n\nIn [this talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nm28nR7UIGEandt=1672s) a profile of conspiracy theorists was sketched as high openness, high neurotiscism. (after reading some mor eliterature it seems to me the openness components provide, well, an opening for ideas, and then the neurotiscism provides the surgency to do something with it). Re: covid, one could observe the following responses among these people. (I'm quite familiar with each, yay 96th percentile openness)\n\n1. belief covid was going to be a disaster - early preparedness (looking for ways to protect before such measures were announced), strict following of measures (or going beyond them).\n2. belief it is a hoax, with the goal to mask some other arbitrary issue - becoming more vocal about said issue and a call to resist.\n3. belief covid is real, but that the expert opinion is wrong (be it about origin, how it is transmitted, how to counter it), - becoming more vocal about how to solve the problem in some different way (e.g. ivermectin [which turned out to be helpfull, if you actually had worms](https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/ivermectin-much-more-than-you-wanted?s=r)).\n\nIn behaviour it helps preparing for bad outcomes if you believe them plausible/relevant, as they gain more emotional weight. That is people who are less neurotic seemed to have just followed measures as they were announced, are seemingly not able to put on a mask correctly, and generally just kept doing what they were doing rather than being alarmed.\n\nAnother observation of myself is that I can very easily perceive ways in which systems/measures/approaches may fail in what they are supposed to do. I say **perceive**, because this is not always accurate, but I (sort of) mediate this by either researching/testing the thing more thoroughly or deciding that even if I know about something I cannot change it and that therefore I should not invest energy in it (either through anxiousness or research), which is not always as easily done as it is said.\n\nAnother example is economic worries (which might or might not be realistic) w.r.t. house,oil and wheat prices (and other geopolitical events, besides the current russia/ukraine event) which have economic consequences. I offset worries like these via what I consider to be dystopia insurance (purchase of [hbars](https://hedera.com/) and other crypto and stocks which I consider asymetric bets)."" "

A (noncynical) way to view the distribution of money is as a distribution of who was able to value things correctly (for those people who have been able to do so in the past, even when you\'re not cynical you cannot deny it is not a neutral valuation). Still, more avenues for valuation of things to happen, with lower barriers to entry, means the process of allocating resources to people who are good at predicting future outcomes accellerates.\n- If there is a prediction market for something where there is a lot of money to be made by making sure the non-consensus outcome is the one which happens, then they create an incentive people to develop/enforce such things.

People cannot do much on hedera besides ~~launder money~~ *sell NFTs* or just, you know, use the application a company has build as part of their job (which is not useable for outsiders). Second to that, to the majority of people who are in crypto (hypothesis) a council with companies like google is just a bunch of usual suspects if you are someone who distrusts institutions, so what seems like a plus to people who are pro-hedera is actually a **minus** to others.\n\nDo a thought experiment, compare the people you know who don\'t invest, those who do through indices, those who do through specific stocks and or crypto and lastly those who are only in crypto (and maybe something like gold). \n\nI think people who\'re pro hedera are quite similar to people who would buy tech ETFs, general indices and well known companies (berkshire hathaway style) and I don\'t think that the majority of that crowd is in crypto yet.

This means that the network will be stable and predictable to use, which is critical for enterprise.\n\nAnother one is **native** fair sequencing, which is important for DeFi once it gets started on hedera. Other networks either already have their own MEV maffia or have one coming up and require secondary services like KeeperDAO, 1inch or chainlink Fair sequencing services to protect users against this. For retail users who make purchases where frontrunning/sandwiching them is not worth the gas cost this does not make a lot of difference (if they even understand what is happening), but for enterprises making possibly larger purchases its quite important to not get their balance extracted.

Because of this it is always the question whether problems/solutions can get critical mass (in both reach and value assigned by receivers) within groups that can act on solutions. This is not even accounting for actors spreading misinformation (either deliberatly or not).\n\nWhat your question in this frame of reference boils down to is whether the bandwidth assignment judgements of people with power (on whatever scale) are correct/efficient. On one hand I think a lot of people make judgements which do not propel them forward as much as possible, yet I run into the issue that that judgement is based on my frame of reference.\n\nI tend to think people try to do the right thing, but whether that results in good outcomes depends a lot on earlier internalised information and resulting value assignments. I think now and when people who were right in making a certain bet get rewarded (can be monetary or intangible assets through actions one has done), which rebalances the societal power dynamics towards people who have foresight. Still, this can take either the form of exploitative foresight or constructive foresight with the consequences each may have. \n\nFurthermore, I find it difficult to guess whether that is too noisy/irregular with a short enough feedback cycle or not to fix problems like the ones you mention.

Ethereum might have defi, as do a couple other coins, but has besides that not really a use case. There are some exceptions but those will, if only because of cost considerations eventually move to hedera. hedera on the other hand, practically only HAS usecases deployed which for other chains do not leave the ""these are things people *could* build""-section.\n\npractically speaking though: in the short-medium term there will be a higher supply. At the same time: consider the ratio between your current proportion of the money supply in dollars, vs in hbars w.r.t. total supply. It\'s likely quite the improvement. You don\'t know what the price will do and I don\'t know, but the question is which change in proportion are you willing to settle for.\n\nI guess this is sort of the argument for bitcoin as well, however, as long as they do not address the scaling issue, they do not have the direct connection with *usefull* compute as usecase.'

They disperse form ethereum, and as users come in for which fees matter they have build the next locations on their mental map.\n\nI see a similar disconnect as you describe with chainlink (securing all their DeFi and NFT VRF bullshit).\n\nMost people do not enter the crypto space because they would like to keep an **unbreakable** digital diary of **everything that happened**, or because they think the innovation of allowing **Oracles to potentially execute value transfering operations directly as a result of natural events**.

Since it (hashgraph and other crypto which are also about efficiency gains) are the literal best on that front I see it as getting in early on the likely next wave of ""western"" currency. local fiat currency is only as usefull as who wants to have it and to pay taxes, cryptocurrency is a requirement to make use systems which will increase competitiveness.\n\nSadly no local broker I know of offers nonleveraged RMB positions, but  if I were going for purely inflation hedges I would rather go for RMB than crypto.

However, if you measure in the amount of actions one could do on the network with the same amount of hbars, this will likely increase as this process progresses.\n\nThe result of this is that early owners of hbars will become rich as the amount of actions they can do continues to increase. Can you explain to me how the fact that people can become rich by doing nothing except for holding on to hbars as other people weave hedera through the fabric of society, like the vine that it is, is not a process which impacts the balance of power?\n\nIt is not much different than holding companies shares which went on to grow a lot in that it gives them access to more resources (money), except for the fact that if hedera succeeds in positioning itself the way it currently seems to attempt, in becoming the ""plumbing"", then everything will come to depends upon it.\n\nIf governments built their systems to handle their citizens payments on top of hedera, and their currency fails then even if they would create a new fiat they would need hbars to be able to continue using their digital infrastrucure, being delivered to the grace of people who own hbars and/or the council.

eRisk2023-T3_Subject21, b'Consequences for standard currency?' , b'2021-12-17 13:00:42' , reddit post ," b'Hi,\n\nI was wondering what others here think about what will happen to more standard currency. hbars are obviously necessary to perform actions on the network, but after looking so much at crypto where this is the case for all L1, it seems the only thing which fiat currency has going for it is its legal tender status.\n\nFrom when I was young, my parents have told me that the best/safest investments is to just invest in index funds and I used to take that for granted, but when you get into crypto one of things you hear people talk about often is inflation/money supply.\n\nIf you look at the money supply of basically any country on sides like [trading economics (m2 belgium here)](https://tradingeconomics.com/belgium/money-supply-m2), you\'ll see it has for every country only increased over the years. it\'s not that companies in the index are doing better, it\'s that they capture a proportional amount of the money supply.\n\nWith companies it is difficult to evaluate what will possibly disrupt them or outcompete them, so parking your savings with them to maintain proportionality is risky, hence why indices work so well for people. However, as all L1 cryptocurrencies practically function as a spread bet on all applications being built on that network, they fulfill a similar role as index funds (with the exception that there are no company-based dividends and the like).\n\nWith bitcoin there was an attempt to maintain proportionality of savings to the whole supply, but with hbar the benefit of indices are baked in.\n\nAs money supplies continue to enlarge, as they seem to do everywhere (x3-x12 over 20 years) over the years (you can change the above url to your country and check compare countries taking the year 2000 as a baseline), what exactly is the point of fiat? Sure, you can legally do transactions in it, but once shit hits the fan there is suddenly a lot more incentive to keep your savings in a different currency.\n\nHowever, shit **is** continually hitting the fan, it\'s just happening on a timescale that does not seem to alarm us. With crypto entire systems of applications run on networks which require them. If I want to do something on hedera, I need hbars: I cannot pay the transaction costs for eth without selling it for hbars first even if I and the counterparty I am doing buisness with would want to. We could do the transaction on another chain, but hedera will literally be the cheapest due to how it is set up. It\'s obviously ""bullish"" for hedera, but looking at the future and I am afraid about the period of transition. In europe countries converted their currency to the Euro (around 2000 when I was still just a kid), which was distributed in a ratio corresponding to local currency. However, as far as I am aware governments are not currently purchasing hbars, so something similar can not be done and people **will** get left behind. (There is only el Salvador which is purchasing bitcoin).\n\nDoes anyone have a bit of perspective on this?' "

Regardless, the treasury is filled by people paying the network for actions done on the network.\n\nHowever, hedera is not isolated. Just as one could have an ROI on an investment in turkey at the moment it matters whether that ROI is paid out in lira or in USD. Similarly to Turkey (or other countries/currencies), it matters how hedera competes in the market. If the GC decides to raise costs of using the network, it becomes more expensive to get anything done for everyone using hedera which possibly incentivices people to use other networks at some future point in time.

The ROI of staking comes from either new tokens being minted or higher utilisation cost for users. \n\nIn the first case it forces holders to stake, if they do not want to lose their % of the total pool. This is literally a wealth transfer from exchange holders to more tech-savy stakers, which is where the actual ROI comes from, as through minting the relative portion of each token to the total supply decreases and as a result event-agnostic price of the token should decrease. Take bitcoin, if there would in the end be 22 million bitcoin, rather than 21, and the amount of money invested would be the same, then the price of each single bitcoin would be inherently lower.\n\nIn the second case, when the ROI originates from paid price to use the service, e.g. UNI or SUSHI, it incentivises people to develop other protocols to fulfill the same function, but with lower margin, to outcompete the original making the token have less value later on. In this case there is an actual ROI, but it is a risky one as the value can disappear if the service is getting outcompeted.\n\nThe currency agnostic value depends on the utility of the network/service/protocol in all cases, and in that regard hbar just wins.'

I realised things which exhibit powerlaws are all forms of energy systems. Accompanying that I hypothezised that the systems which are most energy efficient become the largest. Then I remembered money is pareto/powerlaw distributed and figured looking into crypto might be worth a shot as these were money/energy systems that are in their growing phase. I then dropped the courses I was following at uni and spend 2 months going through all the top 2000 crypto listed on coinmarketcap in an effort to wrap my head around the space (checking the websites and looking at other resources). \n\nWhen I got to Hedera and watched the harvard talk I heard how the gossip protocol spread the transactions where every message on the network spreads the previous messages. This process leads to a logarithmic scaling of time untill information flows everywhere which is usually the best or close to the best you can get in scaling of algorithms. When I then heard that the transaction-cost was independend of the coinprice this solved the ease of use issue both for planning as well as future useability in case the price would rise, which had not been the case for any other crypto that I came accross so far. When I realised both of those things I bought in relatively heavy (with relation to my relatively non-existing income as a student).\n\nSimilar to hedera I got into polygon (matic back then, when it was 20 cents), because it was a crypto on which it positioned itself as being easy - for developers - to redeploy/connect/otherwise scale contracts from ethereum. Furthermore, it was ( /is) positioning itself to become a connection layer for other EVM compatible systems, which means that through an ease of use hypothesis I hypothesised polygon to grow when ethereum fees would become unbearable. This is exactly what has happened during the following spring (through aave, polymarket, decentraland and more).\n\nI mention this not to shill polygon, as I have no idea what reasonable prices are at all, but as an example for things I look for: things which increase ease of use or add missing functionality. \n\nExamples of this are **Oracles** (Information (energy) flow from outside the blockchain to the blockchain), inclusion of randomness in a deterministic system and interopereability mechanisms, all covered by ChainLink (with chainlink labs on the council), as well as kleros  for subjective oracles ((subjective) dispute resolution (which is another form of non-determinism)), iExec/rlc (marketplace for programs for ease of use - no need to set up an API for developers). A **negative example** of this is Cardano, which has chaotic documentation, uninformative names for everything and is written in haskell ([which is not used by many developers](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#technology-most-popular-technologies), which results in a higher (energy) barrier to entry, as well as a lack of troubleshooting on websites like stackoverflow). I briefly considered iota, as it is feeless which should be the lowest energy barrier, but as far as I understand it, it does not have finality(?) which is kind of a dealbreaker for financial applications.\n\nSo far I\'ve mostly looked at crypto, but I\'m looking for anything which fits the ""energy barriers"" philosophy. I would\'ve also liked to invest in linktree and magiclink, but I\'m sadly not sure how I can do that :/' "

Imagine you would have to check the equivalent of the ETH gas-station before doing groceries - or, from the enterprise point of view: when to accept customers coming to your store to minimise gas costs for everyone - hedera removes this class of problem which almost every other base layer will experience at some point. \n- feedback from power-users. The companies on the council will likely become power-users of the systems, people who have a lot of interaction with it and can provide a lot of technical feedback as a result improving the network. every protocal gets feedback form users, but because hedera is marketed/designed towards enterprise form the beginning the feedback they get is connected to high stakes use cases.'

In practice there turn out to be different ways to do this that differ in how good they perform. Ultimately the concept of CNNs are a generalised crafted feature learner.\n\nGeneralising the process of learning a type of feature is so far something people still do. People might have discovered GRUs and other LSTM-type blocks, but that same algorithm did not discover transformers, nor skip connections as an explicit concept for the whole network, nor group equivariant CNNs.\n\nFinding was to include incorporate increasingly more abstract concepts will likely be what data science work will be about I think.

This might be looking at articles from smaller journals in favor of larger ones for example.\n\nI'm personally less sure about my own field (AI), as a lot of company information that is presented publicly is word-salad of buzzwords, with the actual technology (*if* there is anything new at all) basically being kept secret.

Some ""solve"" this by temporarily separating sub populations, causing ""genetic"" drift, but within those sub populations there still is homogeneity. To come back to your analogy: we do not live in a world with only cephalopods in one place and only humans in the other, and these methods are by analogy doing something wrong.\n\nAlso note that both of those are representations. With algorithms I meant the N\'th slight change to basic gradient descent, as far as I\'m concerned there are only 3 methods: basic, momentum and natural gradients. (Or likewise for evolutionary methods with the N\'th name analogy, (bee colony, ant colony, particle swarm, imperialist competitive algorithm), the N\'th ""cooling"" schedule for simulated annealing..., I\'m not well versed in kernel methods but you get the point). I\'m also not bashing people working in this, as improvements are improvements, but these things are just not going to get us to what AI is hyped up to become. I am not well versed in meta learning, maybe there\'s some hope there...\n\nAs for this article, it\'s just bad data science, as direct proxies for the target were part of the features, and the study did not care about retractions which basicly meant the predictor was a measure of popularity instead of science.

This is not so much an approach as to how to do AI, but a view on where growth in AI applicability might come from.\n\nAlthough we have frameworks, both in algorithms and libraries (toch, tensorflow, etc.), applications are still being built very much from ground up, needing data and compute to train models for our private, single, purposes, rather than making use of common established models.\n\nJust like these libraries helped create a boom in development, through abstracting away technicalities, the same growth might happen when we get to the point where rather than importing these libraries, we get to the point where we import things like object classifiers, combine these, and add resulting programs to said library. It will lead to a lot of redundancy when almost duplicate, but slightly different, models/programs are added to this library. I suspect applying information retrieval to this sea of programs will be the solution to that again.\n\nI expect the creation of AI-applications to change from training a language model likewise to GPT-X to a modular approach where one module searches the web, a secondary model is used for consistency/validity/reputation judgement of sources and a tertiary module uses approved information to create an answer. Since determining reliability is difficult, especially accross different subjects, this emphasizes the need for a multitude of models. I also expect the quality of these modules in general to improve as function of utility they bring (modules continually being added to a large library of possible modules and being swapped out for eachother in search of improvement)\n\nI hope this is left field enough ;)' "

More zeros is more difficult because you cannot predict what hash you willget by any other way than hashing something. at the same time, the hash can be verified by everyone easily by doing the same hash. This is a way to make sure the recorded transactions are correct.\n\nin proof of stake, this computation is replaced by a consensus mechanism, where a computer is randomly selected based on the amount of crypto staked. this computer can make a proposal, which is checked by validators. If validators disagree with the block contents, their stake is slashed - they **lose** some variable proportion of their initial stake. if the validators agree, the proposer gets a reward.\n\nIn this way the hashing part of the process is eliminated, which is the part that takes up the majority of energy usage (and more and more energy as more computers join the network), and replaced by a weighted sampling+validation based on amount of staked crypto.\n\nsee also: https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/' "

Unless facebook is willing to let users built keep and decide over what they built, I think they will not be able to keep up with dev speed at the same time as quality.\n\ncurrently its possible for people to build apps on facebook or let people login with facebook and the like, but decentraland has less ""distance"" between projects. It\'s easier to just browse and people are continually building new tools for it. The boon is not so much in the decentralisation, but in the permissionless nature.\n\nGetting people in that do not have an interest in blockchain is a matter of building something that would attract people like that into it. games would be a candidate, but not copycat games, something that is just there. the reason I started going on to the internet as a kid was because there was no analogue equivalent of runescape, so the question is what kind of things can be done in DCL that cannot be done outside or would be unthinkable outside of it.'

Bitcoin is one of the best examples of this I know of, it\'s literally a shorter synonym of ""digital currency"", and most people only know about dogecoin as a second one while there are literally more than 1000 crypto out there, hint their names are usualli obscure, and have meaningless acronyms.

Things like negations can be tricky with NLP and you really are going to hit yourself in the head with a fork if your website gets reported as spreading misinformation about covid.\n\nThird, don\'t force people to login. just like people don\'t want another platform, they dont want another account, if anything let them use magiclink to login. let them see the site without logging in, but only let people with accounts reply if you actually want people to have accounts (atleast, I can\'t be bothered checking further if I cannot login on a site).

See how they represent the issues, assume this is their basic way of representing any issue.\n\nPersonally I think a lot of big-official-ish-media can be compared to a record website that lets you sample 10-second fragments of songs. If I would at all use it, its use would be as a catalog to find topics, after which I\'d search for the whole story as close to the source as possible. If the article contains links I look at the linked page and try to asses the quality of the source, if it seems similar in style as big-official-ish-media, then it\'s time to whip out the ol\' google-fu.\n\nIt used to be the case that writers needed big publishers more than they do now. Distributing things used to be expensive, hence it was often better to publish books, rather than individual chapters. But now that things are distributeable online chapters/blogs can be distributed almost cost-free. Although publishers are still usefull to get an audience who might otherwise not have found your work, good writers can get by easier without them. \n\nIt\'s not that the blogospheres writing is better, it is that in the blogosphere there seems to be a stronger selection bias in what you get to see (optimization goal being topic dependent, rather than publisher dependent), since poorly written pieces would be less likely to get send around in general, as well as that a subset of people in the blogosphere is there exactly because they look for the better writing/info quality (there\'s also a bunch of BS/confirmation bias in blogs, e.g. crystal healing, but people reading slatestarcodex are probably less likely to encounter it, making their perception of the blogosphere to seem to be of higher quality). \n\nIn the context of this article, SSC/ACX is getting more readers and NYT less as the result of this article. As such, the ""problem"" with ""traditional media"" is one that will likely sort itself out, with more and more platforms becoming available to independent creators. Right now, I think, we\'re still just in a transition phase.\n\nedit: spelling' "

(ICLR 2016), I noticed that the cartpole results they have show their method is able to obtain a cost of -10.\n\nFrom my understanding cost is simply negative the sum of rewards, so it would mean a cost of -10 corresponds to a return of 10. From personal experience messing around with the cartpole environment of openAIgym I find that the result of a **random** policy is this score (and lower return, (higher cost), means a performance of *worse than random*). However, in their paper they do not mention the reward function, so it might be that this is different from the OpenAI GYM environment.\n\nIn the paper they reference using the physical parameters of [Barto et. al](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6313077andcasa_token=Zgw5sUgsS4oAAAAA:HefyhUkvhuInfkHN7dStuEWZDq0clOqhm_xW0WE_BQm7XPY5BiS9oBw_eIqvYMsCMrZBlaoOk1g7andtag=1), in which the reward is formulated as negative upon failure (at the end of episodes) (which means positive cost, which they they also do not have)\n\nIt seems strange to me that what is presented as being a good result is actually just showing the algorithm is able to recover random performance from a bad initialization. Thus I wonder if they use a different reward/return/cost function than the OpenAI environment.\n\nDo any of you have any information about this?\n\nEDIT: I know they are not using the gym environment, I mentioned it only because neither that nor  the reward in Barto's paper from 1983 make sense to me, yet I am not aware of different cartpole environments where their results would make sense in\n\nEDIT2: \n- First, Schulman one of the authors of the first mentioed paper in my post, is co-founder of openAI so this makes the Gym-hypothesis more likely\n- Second he published [a benchmarking paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.06778.pdf) with a reward function that is also does not seem congruent with presented results.\n- Third references about the cartpole environment all seem to be about either this benchmarking paper or [Barto's paper from 1983](https://sci-hub.do/https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6313077/?casa_token=YUbPuY5-P6gAAAAA:ZDjQ9CocN0f_IC9Qo-cyej4k2PuudLgMZ3UPkF0pQz9Y8YdED5h2JxnqOqyGROitPSW5W2i3mz0r)\n- Fourth I noticed the link to barto's paper (1983) goes to ieee-explore which requires institution acces, the paper is available via sci-hub though.\n\nEDIT3:\nJohn Schulman has responded in the comments, the reward function is indeed different in their paper, see the correspondence below for specifics.""

This set contains that men need to be strong, solve problems through violence, cannot be emotional, and cannot show feminine qualities. this gets promoted for example in pornography.\n\n>This set causes that men MUST fall in love with woman (because this is masculine), and they do not need to take care of the children (because this is feminine), must not show their emotions, cannot do sports that are feminine need to solve problems through violence.\n\n>Where this set characteristics is promoted is sometimes not so easy to point out, but you can find it very explicitly in pornography, but also more implicitly in for example Dinsey movies (man falls for woman and the man rescues the woman), or in action movies (man does not show emotions and is so strong that it defeats all evil). Man are seldom shown with characteristics that could be called \xe2\x80\x98weak\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98feminine\xe2\x80\x99, which causes man to also not act like this, which can be harmfull in cases.\n\n\nIn this the point is made how, often, masculine figures in media are portrayed and/or expected to be emotionless, solve problem through violent behavior or are shown and expected to have stereotypical characteristics.\n\nRather than toxic, I would call it immature or un-nuanced, and I believe that renaming the concept might contribute to making people more understanding of one another. (assuming this is the defenition)\n\n*Secondly*, when I read the comment on media, I found it a strange notion, untill I realised my frame of reference might be Biased because most of the story-media I consume is not typically western, but Anime from japan.\n\nI would be surprised to find toxic masculinity among my favourite series. (some may be violent, but what is a vampire series without violence (Hellsing)?).\n\nBelow an excerpt my favourite alltime characters and series;\n\n - General Hughes, Edward Elric, van Hohenheim (Fullmetal Alchemist)\n - Motoko Kusanagi (Ghost in the shell)\n - Lain Iwakura (Serial experiments Lain)\n - Yukino Miyazawa (His and her circumstances)\n - Daru (Steins;Gate)\n - Lelouch (Code Geass)\n - Ryuk (Death Note)\n - Hikaru and Kaoru (Ouran highschool Host Club)\n - Ryuji (Toradora)\n - Soul, prof Stein (Soul Eater)\n - Misato (Evangelion)\n - Walter (Hellsing)\n\nnow I have no clue about what that entails culturally, but I do know this:\n\nI got bored with western popular media; And I specifically mean what and how things get(s) popularized (for instance ghost in the shell, which is only a shell (ha!) of the original material with scarlett johansson slapped onto it)\n\nIt might actually be that the accusation of toxic masculinity in film points to something we\'re actually doing wrong:\n\nNot taking the maturity and nuance of audience into account, I do not mean films like ""Good Will Hunting"" or ""Pursuit of Happiness"", but those films which are so much popularized that they even reach me, while having addblocker and not consuming TV media (e.g any (super/anti)hero movie)\n' "

Then, roughly during genesis 2, the normal story with Eve proceeds, but with Lilith coming back, being the snake, wishing to bestow her fellow women Eve with the knowledge she gained.\n\nBefore the advent of christianity, the figure of lilith was already known in other mythologies in different forms (air-spirit, succubus, eternal maiden, babykiller) always leading back to the same character in story and more abundant than since.\n\nWhat makes this interesting is that from a ""patriachal"" view lilith was basicly an archetype of the ""bad"" woman, while from a feminist perspecitve Lilith was the epitome of a women making her own choices and who resisted oppression, while in mythological actuallity being **both**.\n\nWhat I\'m working towards is the following:\n\nWhat to do with Lilith? Most of our cultural approaches have ignored the archetype but it seems to me she is working herself in, through no longer being able to be kept out. How or should we reunite?' "

I didn\'t know him before it and was very skeptical from the beginning (because of his appearance) but found it a really great talk.\n\nOne particular bit, among others, stuck out to me. It was a point I\'ve been thinking about for a long time. The paradox of awareness, or consciousness, if you will. It\'s hard to specifically point out what I mean, but I believe some personal examples will give you a sense of what I mean. \n\nExample 1: Whenever I meet people for the first time in a new group project, I\'ll propose getting them some coffee. I like it as a gesture that says ""I\'m willing to start the arms-race of reciprocity"". One could view this as a beneficial thing, starting reciprocity, but also as a manipulative action and it is not clear which of these it is more than the other.\n\nExample 2: My girlfriend is blind and hasn\'t had the most pretty past (abusive parents and male figures who only saw her as someone who would be easy to have sex with). I like helping her out with things she cannot do herself, moreso, I see it as something any decent human being would do and don\'t see it as something special.

Two of them were simply useless and/or clueless. One was assigned to write the report and had over a period of 4 weeks had only written 1/4th of the report. The end product resulted in a miserable failure. The other\'s task was to investigate methods to pre-process our data, except that he was so clueless he couldn\'t even get the program to work even tough he\'s a study-year ahead of the rest. \n\nMe and my mate ended up doing almost the entire project, but it ended with a result half assed. The writing wasn\'t even close to done near the deadline. The other two group members couldn\'t even run the program while given explicit documentation for every step what to do and how to troubleshoot. Moreso they only started working on the project at 11 am and left at 3 pm and were unreachable after that. I know I should have said something about it, but I felt so completely dumbfounded I couldn\'t. The person writing the report always said it was going fine but never posted what she was actually writing so we couldn\'t work with it or check or help and she didn\'t ask questions either. I believe the mark will be really low, but I\'ve been surprised before, moreso I believe we should have a really low mark and fail the course and will most likely make protest if we *do not fail*. \n\n""Luckily"" the period has ended and thus part of the problems are over. However the new study-period brings all kinds of issues to the table. The documentation for one of the programming language is entirely in spanish, the feedback we get on essays is so late you can\'t even use it for the assignment two weeks ahead and the third subject refuses windows support (,which I\'ve already solved, by figuring things out myself over a course of 3 intensive days).\n\nI probably have too high expectations, but these things have left me so depressed I\'ve started smoking again and it\'s a repeating pattern at this point. \n\nI feel like I\'m complaining too much if I say anything about it, which is why I\'m posting here instead of talking to someone about it, but it\'s honestly driving me insane.\n\nHow does one deal with this?'

eRisk2023-T3_Subject21, b'discussion with my sociology TA/why sociology has so many marxists' , b'2017-10-23 13:48:56' , reddit post ," b'Peterson talks about there being a lot of marxists professors in sociology departments and I might have found a reason other than the conspiricatory ""march through the institutions"" that some would bring up.\n\nSo, I\'ve recently had a discussion with my TA because of the teksts for the class. Now, there\'s been public backlash in general of universities teaching a too left wing view, and this was mentioned in class. (I don\'t entirely agree with this because we have had texts in which the argument is lesser government, less, but we had them and one side is bound to be less, statistically)\n\nThe general critique often comes down to an unbiased political view, my observation however was that more than leftist it is a structuralist view that pervaded the textst of the class, so I went and talked to her about it. Structuralism, for those who do not know, say that actors and their actions are shapen by their environment.\n\nThe commentary she offered is that the discipline of sociology as such **investigates the impact of broader scale processes on individuals**. Also, that the science was not settled on structuralism vs agency, to be fair (interestingly interaction between the two as a possibility has not been mentioned). But the point of it is that the lens of the study as such is structuralist, it places individuals as those who are influenced and not as influencers. What also might be called victims.\n\nI believe that because of this the frame of reference (A ton of theories about how individuals are affected by grand processes) of those studying sociology, their way of thinking could be shifted towards a marxist view (of oppressor vs oppressed) because being subjected to broader processes over which individuals have no power is central to the discipline.\n\n*Am I wrong in my understanding?*\n\n*Is there a way to remedy this?*\n\nas to reference why the march through the institutions is not (consciously) happening: few people who study sociology get work in the field, there just aren\'t so much grants, so they have to do work elsewhere and this frame of reference thus gets spread by people starting organisations and doing social commentary based on that, not because of some conscious plan.'

eRisk2023-T3_Subject21, b'the wests contradictory solution. and group control' , b'2017-10-20 12:47:11' , reddit post ," b'So, there\'s  a lot of talkandpraise about the wests idea of the individual as most important unit. I am not sure if I agree with that. Please bear with me, it\'s probably a bit rough around the edges so please ask me to elaborate if something isn\'t clear.\n\nHowever, I want to make the argument that even if the group would be the most important unit (and thus the question of how to control the group), the individual must be regarded as more important on the basis of an argument by Foucault himself.\n\nFoucault uses the concept of disciplining yourself, controling yourself (think freudian super-ego) as a way to control individuals in his work. He does this trough the concept of panoptiscism.\n\nA crude example comes from Benthams panopticon. This panopticon is a [circular Jail](https://goo.gl/images/W1gG6E) with a tower in the middle from which every inmate *could be* watched. The could be is because the lights in the tower are dimmed and thus the inmates cannot see if they\'re being watched, thus they discipline themselves as to avoid punishment.\n\nThis situation is very akin to people censoring themselves/political correctness ((f)or a better word). What panopticism thus entails is the following:\n\nIf people could be watched they act like ""good"" prisoners(people).\n\nHowever, and this is the important part, this is build on the fact that they, the prisoners, regard themselves as having free will, because otherwise they could not do anything about it.\n\nSo even if the goal would be to controll groups the best way to accomplish that is to hold individuals accountable for their actions.\n\nnow, one abstraction further: let\'s assume there is no ""easy"" speech code to follow for not being arrested. Then holding individuals accountable is the ultimate ""supression"" of deviance/destruction because they have to watch what they say, because they are responsible. thus, theoretically to control population/rule (in an assumed power game situation) judging people as groups IS A LOSING STRATEGY.\n' "

However, those who are not connected with it are confronted with the use of it, the use of something that does not connote things to them, except *those people*.\n\nNow, they offer the solution of education. However, this space where gender would be blurred, is something which has little value attached to people that are not inside the situation of belonging to that category, thus they have no use for it, they (the ""they"") are neither fellow women/men nor potential partners. because of this the interpretive function has a non-value as pronoun value from the viewpoint of male/female binary and is thus an obstacle in language.\n\nI guess what I am trying to say is that what for one group of people can be a stepping stone is for another a builder which is in the way. one group is trying to cross a cliff and the other is walking through it. and even more, part of the group faced with the builder is trying to smash it. It is not exactly a wise (language-) enginering choice and probably needs fixing if we don\'t want groups to polarize more.\n\nsuggestions?' "

It\'s about me generally taking a very contrary view to anything that\'s presented in the course. Now mind you, I go over the text and references pretty thoroughly before work group so it\'s not empty critique and I\'m told I\'m right a lot of the time. Now here comes the thing.\n\nwhat I\'m told is that there are a lot of sociological thinkers and that there is not a clear consensus and that there are also a lot of speakers that agree with my point of view, but that I maybe should try to understand the writers point of view. \n\nBut this isn\'t my issue. my issue is that for example that which is written is an incomplete portrayal of the situation. I\'ll quote an example from my textbook (translated).\n\n> The study of social stratification or social inequality is by no means a neutral matter or without interest. Anyone who writes about social inequality, soon talks about the problem of social justice. Groups who profited of existing social inequality have time and time again tried to justify this injustice [...]. on the other side of the argument, subordinated groups have tried to lay these injustices bare to see.\n\nthe implicit statement in this exerpt is that there is a group with power which profits unjustly and another subordinated group that\'s after the truth of the matter. this is a biased claim which is taken for granted DESPITE what the paragraph starts with.\n\nthe course is full of situations like this and I don\'t know how to deal with it. (except for copying the way of arguing on exams to finish the course, but that doesn\'t solve my personal problem with it and the way it is thought to students).\n\ndoes anyone have suggestions?\n\nEDIT: so I see people argue here that during history there actually were people that were unjustly subordinated and I agree with that.  What I am trying to say however is that in the connotation of the text, ""trying to lay bare these injustices does constitute them being truthfull or rightious"", this may be due to a translation error, but it is the connotation in the original language that I\'m actually trying to emphasize.\n\nanother user pointed out that this may be in part due to being introductory coursework and I agree on that point, but that is also why I am seeking for a solution to this, because not only is this not impartial, it also pushes other views away from the field.

It was excersize 5f\n\nSo me and J went home on an inflatable bob-sled (like used it the olympics but inflatable), when we passed a group of people that asked if they could have it  \n\nThey also had those kind of sleds but theirs didnt have way to hold on to it from the back.\nThey asked if they could have our sled, but they couldnt because it was F\'s.\n\nJ was in front of the sled and I was, instead of holding on ti  the back, balancing myself in a horizontal manner on the back holding of the sled #yolo\n\nWe passed them, but then the path ended.\nWe sled unto the road in my original hometown as a result. I then fell into the air and flat on the ground, got almist overrun, jumped away, fell on my face again and laughed, now safe,  I looked at J.\n\n""I wanna do that again""\n' "

Jordan states it as a good idea to just listen or read and take notes afterward, but I find a problem with that.\n\n\n\nwhile I agree about the the concept, I often have a completely different take-away from a text/essay than what is the intended message. Mostly, after reading a text I actually find the opposite of what's argued more convincing. Normally this is fine because it gives a lot of discussion material with friends. I do believe I've got a pretty good grip on the material (participation in class grade 8.0-9.0) while at the same time being unable to answer a single exam question with certainty(and scoring around 3.5). While studying for my recent exams (for which I am still waiting for the results) I just copied everything that seemed to be of interest to the author, and write it over and over while accepting it as complete rubbish, which I had to push myself through to make the exam. This time the exam went better than before(2nd time I'm taking the course as it is mandatory), I expect, and I might be able to make it through this way. but it seems like a sub-optimal solution.\n\n\n\nI know the reason I find things rubbish is mostly because the arguments being made are either too isolated and thus just seem like sophistry (Hannah Arendts work, labour and action, for example of which I'm still not certain after looking into it more) or just plain badly argued. This however doesn't help me finish my mandatory courses and also feels like a sub-optimal solution. does anyone have an idea on how to fix this problem?\n"" "

It reminded me of a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Z6rsoNcWWU) that's, I would say, almost part of me as a person (video is quite graphic). I've know it for 8 years and I keep coming back to it every one or two months and I keep being awestruck everytime I see it.\n\nIs it possible that it could be some unconscious kind of shadow work/is that even possible? can anyone maybe help me understanding it by watching it and telling me what they see (as if casting a new light on it) or maybe redirect me to a place where people could help me with this? I have this with a couple of other videos as well, which by now I understand, but for this one I just can't put my finger on it.\n\nthanks in advance."" "

As an example incest which I think comes from a desire to feel close to the people around you, while just not being able to due to acquired personality differences.\nHowever some fetishes I simply cannot get my head around. I haven\'t been able to find much of specifics on the internet so now I\'m headed for ""user experience"". If you have the Idea you have somewhat of an ""abnormal"" fetish and an idea why you have it, could you please leave a reply?\n\nEDIT: even if you don\'t have an idea why, if you leave here some things which think shaped you we could theorize to maybe reach a conclusion\nP.S.
