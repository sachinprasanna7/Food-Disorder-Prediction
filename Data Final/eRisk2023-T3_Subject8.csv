First I drew it in pattern paper and then I did a try on some similar synthetic left over fabric my grandma had (from some of her previous projects) so I could see how It was working before moving on to the real fabric I was going to use. It all turned well besides the ruffle, I had to redo them with a smaller radius and that change made the drape of the ruffle so much better. Once I sew everything together I added the silvery trims so It would look a bit more elegant for a wedding. Hope you like It!' "

When we Split the groom stayed with the girls, but soon he started going with some other boys who also got invited to the bachelor weekend but now he has barely no relationship with the girls. That is why I dont understand why they got invited and I didn't. The only reason I can find is that they got invited to the weeding individually and I got invited as a +1."" "

A couple years ago the group got a little divided into two sides, on one side there were all the girls and the groom, and on the other side were all the boys (except the groom) and me. When we got the invitations I realised that I had been invited as my boyfriend\'s +1 and the rest of the people had been invited individually. I was a bit dissapointed, but as I couldn\'t really do anything about It, I let It go. Then his brother in law started to organize his bachelor party and he invited all the group of Friends, incluiding boys and Girls, but as I was the only one invited as +1, I did not get invited to the party. I told my boyfriend to say something like ""hey why have you not invited her, as she is also a friend of ours"", but he refused to say nothing. The party was this weekend and I missed It. I am feeling really lonely and also a little bit mad with my boyfriend, but he does not get my point. AITA?' "
