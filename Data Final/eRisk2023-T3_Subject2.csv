I usually don\xe2\x80\x99t mind ambiguity but it felt unintentional. Also I didn\xe2\x80\x99t care for the kid actors in it, I didn\xe2\x80\x99t think they were great.' "

eRisk2023-T3_Subject2, b'I feel guilty about grieving.' , b'2022-06-01 19:01:31' , reddit post ," b'My cousin (through marriage) killed herself a few weeks ago. She was 16. I\xe2\x80\x99ve known her for all her life. I have felt so utterly sad and heartbroken. I knew her pretty well, but there are people in my family who knew her much better (my step siblings, my dad, her mom obviously\xe2\x80\xa6) so I feel bad about how sad I am. Is this my grief to have? I mourn her so frequently. And I mourn that I didn\xe2\x80\x99t get closer to her. But I feel awful confiding in my family. I feel awful for wanting attention during this time. Most of all, I just feel awful that my beautiful, mixed, huge family is now forever broken. How am I supposed to feel? Am I being too sad? Am I being a burden?' "

If I feel better in a few days, can I have penetrative sex with my male partner? Or any other kind of sex? Sex is important to me but so is my health. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know what to do.' "
