I don't know why I do it, I just feel like doing it to myself. Also like you said, I'll sometimes starve myself because I feel like I don't deserve to eat.

For me it started out when I was stressed or angry but now it just happens daily, like I just don't really feel like eating. I don't even remember when was the last time that I enjoyed food honestly. "

It just means that if you are trying to go back to day 4 or whichever saved point you want to go back to, depending on the time that it is, you may have some missed chats but you will still go back to day 4.

For example: let's say the first chat for day 4 starts at like 12:00pm. Right now it's like 4:00pm for you and you decide to load day 4, when you go back to day 4 you are going to have missed chats and the only chat that you will be able to actually participate in is the chat for 4:00pm.

There's nothing really wrong with the game and closing and opening the game isn't going to do anything. What you just got is pretty much a notification saying that if you go back to that day you might have some missed chats.

I'm not really sure if that helped you understand that a bit better or not, I'm very terrible at explaining things.

Edit: the very first chat for day 4 starts at 12:18 am. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2021-10-18 02:17:09 , reddit post ," I like to dress plainly as well. I don't really like anything too flashy and mostly wear things that will cover my whole body. I just feel more comfortable and safer that way. My mom on the other hand hates the way I dress. She always tries to get me to wear something that she wants but she just doesn't understand that it's just my style.

I actually can't go shopping for clothes with her. She'll literally judge me for anything that I pick and would just end up buying clothes that she wants me to wear, and even if she does decide to keep something that I've picked out, she'll just take it out of the cart when we are about to pay. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2021-10-18 02:09:06 , reddit post ," It's alright if nothing really happens some days. Although you could always change that by doing something, even if its just watching a movie, cleaning the house, or just taking the time to take good care of yourself. Learn a new recipe of a dish you might like, then you can say that you at least learned and tried something new today.

I read your other posts, the ones about how some people left you. I kind of know how that's like. I was a very out going and talkative lou kid when I was in middle school. I had all sorts of friends and always tried everything to please them. From giving them snacks whenever I could afford them or give them my work so they can copy, even help them whenever they were upset. Then when I reached high school they all kind of just left. They stopped talking to me and some even ignored me. I got pretty depressed. I would walk around with my head down, sit alone in classes and in lunch, just never really bothered to try and make new friends because of that, everyone already had their own groups. I felt pretty betrayed that no one was there for me and I honestly just got worse from there. But I learned that not everyone that you meet will always stick around. People will come and go, and it won't be because of you, but because they wanted to leave. Maybe they just want a change in their life so they just decide to stop talking to some poeple. But you know, not everyone you meet will be like that, some will choose to stay around you.

I know how it's like to have someone that you thought you were close with leave you when you needed their help the most. It's hard, but respect their decision, you don't really know why they did it. Maybe they can't handle those kinds of situations, who knows. But that's definitely not a sign for you to hurt yourself. It was just bad timing in some sort of way. "

 I hope that you are at least feeling somewhat better today and that you've had at least one good meal. Also, hopefully someday we can start to eat better again.

Let me know if you feel alone or if you want to talk. I know a lot of people say that and some people don't really like it but I just want you know that you don't have to be alone all time, you know? It's good to have our alone time but it's also good to talk sometimes when you are feeling down.

I'm not very good at conversations but I try to do my best with them. I can also kind of relate with the whole food disorder thing. I've never really eaten much but ever since I graduated from high school my eating habits have gotten worse. I can barely finish a meal now and somedays I'll even hide my food because I just won't feel like eating. I would purge since I usually feel sick whenever I eat but my body just won't let me.

I'm living in my mom's old house with my brothers and am jobless since I have a hard time communicating with people irl. I also get really anxious whenever I'm alone with a stranger so that's pretty much another reason why I have a hard time applying for jobs. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2021-10-12 00:10:21 , reddit post ," I feel this way whenever I go outside and sometimes when I'm at home. It's one of the reasons why I don't really like going outside, I would start to feel panicked and scared. When it's at home I just feel like someone is watching what I'm doing. Like if I'm playing a game or pretty much doing anything, maybe just out of curiosity. It's never really in a bad way, especially when it's at home. But I do feel scared when I'm outside because I feel like someone could be staring at me through their window and I really don't like receiving attention from strangers. I know that no one is looking at me and that no one really cares about who I am but I just can't help feeling that way.

I'm pretty sure that this fear of mine came from my high school years because I've started to feel that way ever since the 11th grade. I always had my head down and was always alone, and I guess keeping my head down brought thoughts to my head like people are probably looking at me and making fun of me. Sometimes people would look at me and I would notice. I would hate whenever I would have to present something for class because all I could see is people staring at me.

But yeah, I definitely get how this feels, maybe it's not exactly the same way that you feel, but I can kind of understand the feeling. "

I can kind of relate, I'm 19 and pretty much never had a job either. I can't talk over the phone most of the time, I've been stuck in my room for years now. I don't really leave the house or talk to people face to face, I start to feel really panicked for some reason. I need to go and apply for a job as well and I really want one so I can get out of the house that I live in, but I'm kind of stuck as well. I have no motivation and feel really stressed out looking through the jobs that are near me since most of them require experience or petty much dealing with costumers. I know for sure that I'll end up having panick attacks if I get the jobs that address available near me. So yeah, it's a bit stressful.

I know this is something that you probably don't want to hear and I kniw it's kind of not right for me to say this but I hope things don't work out and that you keep living. It's hard and life is pretty crappy and miserable but I know that good days will come as well, they always do. I hope you get to take better care of yourself and heck I need to do that as well.

I feel really panicked around people and she usually just says how going to college or getting a job will help me. She tells me how it's all just in my head and that there's no point of being upset when I have such a good life.

I would walk with my friends in the halls or whenever we went out to go to a gas station near by to buy some snacks. I was going through a hard time back then and I started to grow quieter and quieter.

I thought about this a lot, that if I just went and walked the opposite direction and just disappeared from their view they wouldn't even notice or even ask me where I'm going., and it was honestly true. Sometimes I would wonder off and see if they noticed and they honestly just kept walking, wouldn't even look back to see if I was there. That's when I pretty much realized that it didn't matter if I was with them or not. I guess they just stopped thinking that I was fun or something, maybe thats why friends kind of just part ways. "

I used to do that a lot when I was in high school. Now whenever I try to talk about my problems all I do is cry and can never speak about the things that I want to say.

I once had a friend (let's call him dave) who did that to me as a joke. So dave showes his friend (lets call him bob) some texts that I sent him. So then bob comes up with a ""joke."" Bob tells dave to give him my username so he can text me that dave had passed away. At that time, I was with my cousins, one was asleep, and the other I was playing a game with. In the middle of the game I got a text from bob, saying if I knew dave and he has passed away.

Dave was a very special friend to me, talking to him always made me feel better, but he never knew that. Bob asked me some stuff and all that I could say was if he was joking and that he had to be joking, I just couldn't believe it until it finally hit me. I was crying out loud infront of my cousins, and ended waking everyone up.

Then my friend dave texted me, pretending to be bob, he even called me but said that the mic was broken so he couldn't talk. I did find that suspicious but I couldn't really think straight so I was just crying. As soon as he heard me crying over the phone, he asked why I was crying and I literally couldn't even answer him.

Then later when I went to my room he ended up telling me that it was just a joke and that he was sorry.

I felt the same things you did. I felt angry and sad but at the same time I was happy that he was okay. I stayed friends with him for a while longer but then I unfriended him a while ago since I wasn't really doing all that well and I felt stupid for staying friends with him. "

   I've already graduated high school and still have no job nor have any idea of what I want to study or be in the future. Everyone always ask me what my goals are and I just honestly have none. I have no motivation whatsoever. All I do is stay in my room and sleep for comfort. I get told off constantly about how I should find a job or go look for a college. I honestly don't even want to go to one. I've tried looking at done courses that I could take but I'm just not interested in anything. Everyone's always reminding about how people my age already have jobs and are achieving their goals, it gets me so tired.

  My family always tell me how I can trust them, yet continue to use my problems against me. One time, one of my brothers heard me crying (It was the first time that I've tried telling my mom how I was having a hard time) and a few days later he just ended up saying that I'm crying as an excuse to be lazy. Now I don't even trust my own family with anything and am afraid that if they hear me talk about my problems then they'll continue to criticize me.

  I get so stressed out that my only comfort is sleep. I sleep a lot, even if I'm not tired, I'll force myself to sleep. It's so peaceful, at least when I don't get interrupted. Whenever I do try to have a bit more of peace someone just comes into my room and yells at me. I also have no privacy in this house, it gets so bad that I flinch everytime someone comes into my room because I feel like they are going to yell at me. I can't change clothes in my own room, I can't speak to people on my phone, or even cry in peace without having someone come into my room.

  I've been staying inside my closet for privacy, but ever since they've found out they just go to the closet door and open it because they know I would be there. My mom caught me once in the closet and she told me how I wasn't normal and that I shouldn't be there. I've been having to go there whenever she's not around, because she's been trying to keep me out of there, telling me how it's just going to drive me crazy. But it's really the only place where I have privacy. She even put stuff in it so I won't be able to go in.

  I'm so tired, I wish I could go under a dark bridge all curled up and die peacefully in my sleep. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2021-05-25 21:16:08 , reddit post ," I had a place like that when I was in high school. I went to two schools that were near each other at the time, I had two classes in my first school and two classes plus my lunch break in my second school. Between them were a tennis court, behind the tennis court there were a few trees close together.

There was this one tree that would pretty much hide you if you went near the trunk. Students used to go there to smoke weed but later on a teacher found out and kicked them out so it was pretty much left alone. I decided to go there one time since students stopped going there and later on it turned into my comfort spot.

I used to go there whenever I had bad days or whenever I just wanted to be alone. I would sit in one of the branches and listen to music while having some snacks. It was so quiet there, so peaceful. It really helped me a lot.

It was nice while it lasted, but later on in the following year the trees were all cut down. It really bummed me out that I no longer had the tree but then covid happened so. "

Whenever I play cod I get some friend invites from people that aren't even in the same team as me or just random invites from people I get teamed up with. It's like once they see that there's a girl on the lobby they send a friend request for no reason what so ever.

I've learned by now that the only reason why I get friend invites is because I am a girl and that honestly sucks cause you don't know if someone truly just wants to be your friend because they had fun playing with me or becuase they just want to ask a girl out. I've had multiple guys send me invites and when I ask why they say because they want to be my friend, then a few minutes pass and they ask if I'm single.

I was so tired one time that when a guy asked if I was single I told him that I had a boyfriend, then a few days passed and he asked if I was still single, then proceeds to say jk. "

Also if you do leave your house during the night or even during the day, bring a pen with you if you don't have anything else. Next time someone grabs you, try to stab them somewhere and run as fast as you can. Literally, stab him or her in the eyes if you need to. "

I don't really have many friends either since I usually just kept to myself a lot and never really bothered to try to talk to anyone when I was in school. So it's kind of fun being able to talk to people whenever I can.

Also, I just wanted to say that you have a right to complain, cry or just be upset. You are going through a tough time and you should be able to express your emotions and talk about how you feel. Yeah some people may have a bit of a hard life but that doesn't mean that you aren't going through a lot yourself. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2020-08-16 05:23:51 , reddit post ," I know, holding these emotions are unhealthy, I've been doing it for a long time and I still do. Would it really be alright to tell him how I feel and bring up the conversation even though it happened last year and I already told him that it was alright and that I accept his apology. That's pretty much what I've been thinking and I'm really unsure. Plus I feel like if I ended up trying to bring it up I'll end up crying cause honestly it gets to me every time I think about it. "

But he ended up texting me around 2 months ago and now I have him as a friend again. I know it's kind of dumb, but it's kind of hard since he's kind of helped me out when I was upset some days, although he doesn't know that. I'm kind of giving him a chance in some sort of way, but if he does that to me again I would probably say somethig about it. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2020-08-16 04:19:01 , reddit post ," yeah I know. I'm still friends with him, even though his apology was terrible. He did it in a group call with the friend that came up with the idea, and they were both laughing. They did it to some of his other friends and they had different reactions than me so he didn't think that I was going to cry. I kind of wish I would have told him how I felt that day, but I just said that Iw as tired and left the call.

Honestly I'd be down to hang out but I'm guessing that I don't live near anyone.

It would still be cool if we could all just like go on a group call together and just hang out for a bit. Probably do some activities like drawing or playing games together. "

Although for me it was sleeping for around 10 to 15 hours each day. I feel like you should bring your parents aside and tell them that you need to have a serious conversation with them. Tell them how you are feeling and if they interrupt you or start pulling that whole it's the internet getting to you talk, at least ask them if you can go to someone like a therapist for it. You deserve to be able to just vent and get help. The longer you just stay quiet and do nothing about it, the worst it gets. Even if it's just a simple call, it might help.

And yes, you are worth living. I know these negative thoughts can get to us sometimes, but just remember that that's all what they are, thoughts. Negative thoughts that just want to mess with you. Just remember that you are worth it, and this may be cheesy but it's true. Everyone deserves to live and no one is worthless. "

Don't be upset but be happy. You have brought those little miracles into this world. Who knows what kinds of things those kids can bring into this world.

Before heading to gym class I went to the cafeteria to get a poptart and a juice for breakfast. I guess the lunch lady noticed that I wasn't doing very good that day and  pointed out some hot chocolate that was in a counter near by. She told that I could have some and poured some for me in a cup. It tasted like water but I drinked the whole thing. I thought that what she did was very nice of her. That little kind gesture made my whole entire day less gloomy. I'm not sure if she remembers that day since it happened quite the while ago, but I still remember her kindness towards me. I wish I could go back to that school and tell her how she helped me that day. "

I didn't get along with any of the students so I always ate with the janitor and the nurse at the roof. I worked in a restaurant and a bakery and was in a group called the hang out.

I felt this way with a friend of mine that was pretty much a whole lot older than me. Kept making me uncomfortable with pictures and a cringy nickname he once called me. I just didn't say anything at all and tried keeping my distance from him, until a few days ago.

He sent me a picture that made me uncomfortable ( I guess people found it funny including him). I told him that I would appreciate it if he didn't send me those kinds of pictures anymore since it made me uncomfortable. He called me a karen because of that. I told him that I didn't want to be his friend anymore for the reasons that I had and right after that I saw his true colors.

Don't be friends with someone you don't feel comfortable with. Just tell them what's going on. They may react in a calm way or they might go the opposite way. But it's better to do this rather than keeping it to yourself like I did.

Also, does telling someone that I don't find what they send funny make me a karen? Not that I told him that. "

I didn't hear any of the lunch ladies saying it to the other students. I was feeling really bad that day. I wanted to ditch and just have the day over with.

My first class was gym and I'm always alone during that time (even in my other classes I'm alone and have no one to talk to). I knew some people but we weren't really close. So I always spent the class by myself walking around the gym since I was too shy and scared to ask anyone if I could play with them. When she offered me that hot chocolate, it was just the best feeling. I'm not sure why but that made me really happy.

I'm not sure if she noticed that I was upset but I like to believe that she did. Sometimes they would even ask if I'm okay and I would usually just put a fake smile and say that I'm just tired. But yeah, the hot chocolate tasted like water but I drank the whole thing with a smile on my face. "

I had no idea why I found it so funny. I was crying fron laughing so much and I went out to the hallway since the teacher called us to talk about something.

I tried calming down and I held in my laugh (you know that noise that comes out of your mouth when you are trying to hold in a laughter and it just comes out forcefully), well that happened to me and everything in the classroom went quiet.

I was so embarrassed that day and had to keep going in and out of the classroom since the laughing just kept coming and going. "

We helped each other out and I told him stuff that was happening to me. I usually keep things to myself since I also had bad friends that weren't there for me when I needed them the most. Later on he ended up falling for me and told me, I wasn't sure about it because of my trust issues in being in a relationship.

I guess I had enough trust in him and I started to like him so I confessed around a month later. He always told me how he would wait for me and say all kinds of things. I asked him if he would wait until we are a bit older since I fealt like I wasn't all that ready. When I did he didn't say anything back and started talking about this girl that he used to have a crush on. That's when it hit me that he had mixed feelings (which is what I thought when he first asked me out. He told me it wasn't and that he was so sure that he like me). I guess he got mixed feelings from me being nice to him since he doesn't really get that much from anyone.

So uh yeah, gave him some advice that may help him with his crush (since her bf had broken up with her) and I told him to just forget about me telling him how I felt. I'm kind of over it but I still regret confessing. My first teenage confession. Now I kind of feel scared being around guys. I don't want to feel anything for anyone for a long while. "

During the 12th grade, I told my friend how some stuff was happening to me, ( I'm usually not very talkative and keep things to myself ) while I was still talking my friend said that I was being quite talkative today (it sounded like she was annoyed ). I felt terrible. I've been  questioning lately if my friends actually care about me. They all have problems as well and I've always tried my best to help them out when they need it. They haven't really talked to me in months, they knew that I wasn't doing so well either and after that incident with my other friend I've felt like I didn't want any friends, cause like what's the point of having friends online if you aren't going to talk to each other. So I unfollowed some friends and unfollowed the girl that I was friends with at school. That very day that I unfollowed her she texted me, asked if I wanted to hang out and said that I should follow her on insta (which is where I unfollow her from, even though we still have each other's numbers).

eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2020-06-17 21:02:08 , reddit post ," I've had friends like that before. It used always be me that had to text them first, if I wanted to talk with them, they wouldn't really text me at all. Whenever we walked it was always in a line, they would walk together while I always ended up walking behind them.

If I was with them and one of their friends came up, they would leave me and go to that friend, ir if their friend joined us, my friend would talk to her friend and ignore me. But whenever they are alone and have no one to talk to they would come to me, which always made me feel terrible. It's so sad that I even tried to be around them as much as I could and I would let them use me like that since I didn't want to be alone.

It really sucks to be the second choice or even be the last choice that they've got. I just kind of tried to avoid them later on, sometimes they would say hi and invite me to hang out with them but it always lead to the same thing, just me sitting down and having to listen to them talk. Now they don't even acknowledge me and I'm really fine with it. It's better to lose friends like that than having to feel miserable spending time with them.

If you ever want to talk just tell me, I don't mind meeting new people. We can even try being friends if you would like. "

It got to the point that I felt so lonely and lost trust in people. I always kept things inside ever since. One time I tried telling a friend how I felt and all she said was ""aren't you being quite talkative today"", that literally crushed me and I stayed silent for the rest of the time.

Or maybe you can go out for a run. I've heard that running can help clear your mind.

I've had friends that only came to me when they wanted snacks, when they had no one else around but as soon as they saw someone they knew they would leave me and go to them, friends that walk in a line together but always left me behind, people that were my friends because I'm a girl ( they ended up saying a lot of uncomfortable things to me ). But then again I do feel like having good friends would be nice, I have been feeling pretty lonely and start to think that I don't need anyone but deep inside I know that I do. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2020-06-14 19:15:56 , reddit post ," I also can't be around the opposite gender or look at girls straight in the eyes. I sometimes do the same thing when it comes to looking at myself, I start to compare myself with other girls and my self-esteem gets very low. When you see yourself in the mirror and see things that you don't like, instead of criticising yourself try to see what you could do to change things a bit. If you don't like how your arms are thin, you can try eating a bit more or maybe do some exercises to improve your arms. You can think about the positive things about yourself like how you have long arms, you can reach things that are higher, some people can't do that. Honestly I'm a young adult that's 4'11 with a baby face and it's a bit hard sometimes but I try to find the good things about looking this way. And if you can't find any then try to think about how you are. Are you a nice person, are you honest, do you help people, stuff like that. At least that's what helps me bring my self-esteem a bit more up. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2020-06-14 18:52:05 , reddit post , I'm sure you are not ugly. You just need to gain some confidence in yourself like I did. And if people say that you are then don't listen to them.

It's like I want to wear a nice dress for once and I feel very happy in it, since most of my life I've been a tomboy and don't really wear many girly things. But going outside is the problem or when people comment on me weraing a dress. When I walk to my church and people are around I feel so much weight in my shoulders. I start feeling like they are looking at me with bad intentions which really scares me. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2020-06-14 18:45:39 , reddit post , Me too. I'm literally terrified of being around people that are my age.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2020-06-14 18:39:25 , reddit post ," This is pretty relatable to me. I hate going outside because of that same reason. I feel like people are staring at me but not in a good way, even if they aren't, and it makes me feel uncomfortable. I used to get so much anxiety during gym class, it was the worst thing. I would feel like crying cause I would feel so scared being around people, especially when the activities began. It was worst when we either had to play volleyball, basketball or just walk around the gym. I would always walk around caus eI didn't have anyone to play with and I'm really shy around people unless they show that they are nice. I don't know why I was so afraid of getting hit by a ball, it literally felt like if I got hit by a ball (which I did multiple times) It would be the worst thing that could happen. I guess I felt like people would laugh at me or that they would be doing it on purpose. I don't really know what might help with these kinds of things but music does help a lot. I would keep my head down a lot but try to keep your head up as much as possible. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2020-06-11 19:28:07 , reddit post , My OCD makes me double the things I do sometimes. Sometimes if I accidentally hit something with my arm I pass by that object so that my hand can hit it again. I've gotten a whole lot better at controlling it. I wanted to share this cause something happened not too long ago that I thought it was a bit funny and dumb. I was eating a sandwich and accidently inhaled through my mouth and I almost chocked. But then that dumb instinct kicked in and I did it again without even thinking twice and ended up chocking on some bread crumbs that I was still chewing.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2020-06-11 18:39:42 , reddit post ," When my mom thought that going to a resort would be a good place to celebrate my birthday. We stayed in a room that was connected to another room, which her boyfriend (that I was meeting for the first time and didn't know that he was going to be with us) stayed with his two daughters and two sons.

The back door didn't lock and there were woods on the other side of the door. I had to sleep in a couch and I ended up getting my period that same day.

I couldn't go to any of the pools or the hot tub or water rides. I stayed sitting in a chair the whole entire time while my family was having fun with the other family.

I was able to go to an arcade with my brother and the guy's kids while my mom and her boyfriend went to a gym. My brother and I were left alone by the other kids cause they wanted to play bowling, didn't even offer if we wanted to play with them. My brother and I were just sitting in the floot of this arcade while everyone was having fun. It was embarrassing and I really wanted to leave. After around four hours of doing nothing my mom came and we were finally able to leave.

The only thing I enjoyed about that day was that when I was sitting in the chair I got hungry and since I had enough money to buy myself a slice of pizza and a soda I did just that. So I bought the pizza and a soda and sat down on the chair that I was sitting at before and watched everyone was have fun while enjoying my food. I had a little good moment to myself until my phone died and I couldn't listen to music anymore. Then the rest of the time was just me sitting in the chair and watching kids like a creep. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2020-06-08 02:41:50 , reddit post ," I had friends in middle school that were using me, at least that's what I feel like they were doing. I only realised it when I got to high school. In middle school, they would only come to me whenever I had snacks. If they were alone they would come to me since they had no one else. When they had a friend or saw someone they knew, they would go to them and wouldn't even look or talk to me much.

When I got to high school they just stopped talking to me. Sometimes they would say a quick hi but that's about it. I thought this happened because we had different classes. But then when it kept occuring and I kept losing friends to the point that they wouldn't even say hi, I started to think it was me, that maybe I was just a boring person to be around with.

 I tried not to make any more friends during my 11th grade years. After one of my friends that was pretty much doing the same things as the others told me to stay in this spanish class with her. She knew everyone in there but I didn't, but I stayed for her cause I thought that maybe I can still be her friend. The. She left that class, alone, because she couldn't stand being in the same class as her ex. Now I understand that it might be hard for some people but she could have at least told me.

But um yeah, finding good friends can be hard for some people like myself. Always stay alert when it comes to meeting peope, make sure you don't get in the wrong crowd but also don't jump into conclusions. It takes time. "

Best movie I've watched with my mom. My brothers weren't interested in watching it, but I enjoyed it. Also so did my mom, she would let me watch chucky wich was my favorite movie to watch when I was little. I think that's why horror movies don't really scare me. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2020-06-06 09:00:05 , reddit post ," So I had this friend, he always hugged me and he honestly made me feel uncomfortable. It got to the point that I would try to avoid him in the hallways and tried to stick to one of my friends so he wouldn't hug me or poke my shoulder( which btw hurt a lot since I'm very weak). Long story short, I was heading to my chemistry class and I saw him right infront of it, so there was no way of avoiding him. He tried to stop me and I got a bit scared so I told him that I needed to go inside before I was late to class. He stopped me, I tried to go around him and he blocked me again. He grabbed my hand, then my face. It felt like a scene from a movie except it wasn't romantic whatsoever. He put my face against his and asked me out. I said ""no I'm sorry but I only like you as a friend and I'm not interested in dating."" Which I wasn't cause I was afraid of dating and kind of still am. He said please, it got awkward, and I said no ones again. People were around, I'm not sure if they saw what happened but I know that there were people behind me. It was so bad, I felt really bad. I said sorry once again while he was leaving and he ignored me so I went to class. Then a few months pass and he starts hugging me again. But now I've graduated so I don't have to deal with that again. And he seems to be doing good so I'm glad for him. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2020-06-06 08:40:41 , reddit post , For me it's being around people or having to make I contact. I can't stare at someone in their eyes for more than 10 seconds.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2020-06-06 08:25:32 , reddit post ," My mom told me that being depressed was just in my head and that there was no point of being upset. She just kept saying that she didn't know why I was depressed cause it's not like anything was happening in the house. That I should be strong like her. I was depressed for around three and a half year and never told anyone except for my three friends. I finally had the courage to tell her one day and she responded with that. Now I have even more trust issues and don't tell my mom anything. I was crying one time in the bathroom during since I started to get anxiety during my 12th grade year. My friend told my teacher and the teacher brought me to the counselor. I didn't tell anyone anything and when she finished trying to get me to open up she called my mom, my mom came and she recommended my mom to get me a therapist. She said she will but she never did, she just forgot about it. I now say nothing to no one around me and keep things to myself as much as I can. I feel like my mom just wants everyone to think that there is nothing wrong with my family. Although she had a rough childhood as well, I'm not sure how to think about things anymore. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2020-06-06 07:59:10 , reddit post ," Not sure if this is funny but it's funny to me whenever I remember this. It was my first time ditching school. I managed to leave pretty easily since one of the schools that I went to has two separate buildings. Which meant that some students had to leave the main building to go to the other one. So it was lunch time. I finished eating and left. Btw, my aunt's house is near my school which is why things ended the way it did. I was walking, it was quiet and peaceful outside. I was a bit excited since it was my first time. I don't usually do this and I've ways been that quiet and shy kid that always follows the rules. So about ten minutes in I thought to myself, ""wouldn't it be funny if mom came to aunt's house today and saw me ditching."" I laughed at the idea. Then, around five more minutes of walking I turn a corner, and there she was. My mom, heading to my aunt's house through the same way where I was heading. I didn't see her at first but she saw me. Then she called me, and the second I saw her I knew, that I was quite done for. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2020-06-06 07:38:08 , reddit post ," I mean I've had a crush on a guy that didn't have an arm, and I don't really mind being with someone that is disabled. Wouldn't that be considered weak for some people? Although I don't really see them as weak. I see them just like I see anyone else. I understand what you are saying and like you said you are just saying what you think, and that's totally fine. But I guess what they are traying to say is that not every girl thinks that way. They are just trying to tell you what they think as well and find what you are saying a bit offensive since not every girl is like that. It makes them feel like they are being targeted which I'm sure it's not what you are trying to do. I guess I understand both of your perspectives but I'm not really good at explaining things. I don't mean this in a mean way or anything. I'm just trying to explain some stuff in my point of view about your comment and the girl's comment. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2020-06-06 07:26:14 , reddit post , I feel like that's kind of true but then again not every girl is like that. I mean some guys do the same thing. Everyone has their own preference.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2020-06-06 06:38:02 , reddit post ," For me it's not being able to think properly, a lot crying and feeling panicked. I keep telling myself not to cry over and over again. Then start feeling really dizzy and then back to an empty mind while having a bit of trouble breathing. Also staring at the floor for a bit. Sometimes I just end up closing my eyes while trying to cover my ears so I won't hear anything. I usually calm down in a bit. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2020-06-06 05:43:51 , reddit post ," I know right. I had this friend that was kind of similar to me and we were both helping each other out with our problems( pretty much depression). We would try to help each other feel better by sending dog pictures and by just saying positive things to each other. We got along pretty well. He told me one day that he liked me but I felt like he was just having mixed feelings because he has told me before that people weren't really nice to him and that he liked this girl but she had a guy already. But then after he confessed he started telling me how he was so sure that he like me and to just think about it. Later on I kind of fell for him since he had gained my trust and has just been seriously making me feel really special. I told him that I liked him as well ( I've never really dated anyone since I'm shy and I'm scared of getting hurt). But when I did, he started talking about the other girl and long story short he did have mixed feelings the whole time. I cried over a guy which is something that I felt really pathetic about. He didn't just make me cry but he also pretended like nothing even happened afterwards. Now he doesn't even talk to me and I kind of wish I wouldn't have ever confessed. "

They are only my friends because I'm a girl and are always asking questions that make me feel uncomfortable which sucks. I do have two friends that I know from school but they met new friends so they don't really talk to me as much. But I guess that's just a part of life.

Except I don't really have depression anymore, just anxiety, and I never really got therapy because my mom just thought that it was ""all in my head"" as she likes to say. And that was the day I had enough courage to tell her that I had depression, never really told her that I have anxiety. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2020-06-06 04:27:26 , reddit post ," I used to be a talkative, fun, and wacky kid during my middle school years and half of my ninth grade year. When I got depression ( pretty much because I had lost all of my friends and found out that I was just someone that they would talk to when they had no one else around) I got really quiet, always kept looking at the ground and never really looked at anyone or talked to anyone. I always had to put fake smiles for the teachers and had lost trust in people (a lot of people that seemed nice to me were just using me so they could get something out of it like copying some work that I had finished while they were talking with their friends and not paying any attention what so ever). I still don't really trust people and try not to get close to them too much, although it would be nice to have someone I can trust. Near the end of the eleventh grade I haved lost my depression. Then during my twelfth year I got anxiety and was afraid of being around people. I started to feel really uncomfortable whenever someone would try to speak to me or by just having someone near me. Honestly I still do feel that way and I still don't trust people as much. But now that I have graduated I won't have to deal with these feelings anymore. At least not until I start college. Also I only feel those kinds of things around other people my age or people from my school. It was mostly because of how some people from my calsses (I won't go into detail because this is already long enough) that I kind of just turned out this way. Or maybe it was just me doing this to myself, idk. Also if you have read all of this I would like to say hello. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2020-06-06 02:43:08 , reddit post ," Skipping school. The first time that I did it was because I was having really bad anxiety and was about to cry. I hate crying in school and was tired of hiding in the bathrooms so I ditched. It was easy really, there are classes that are in another building across the one I was in. So after lunch, some students leave the main building to go to the other. I left and decided that I would walk two and a half hours home. Btw, my aunt's house is near my school and my mom has been recently going to her house. While I was walking I took some time to cry, looked at some houses, took some deep breaths, and saw some birds and squirrels which helped me feel better. So about ten minutes in from walking I said to myself, ""wouldn't it be funny if mom went to aunt's house today and saw me."" I laughed, it was quiet and peaceful for a bit, until about five minutes later, I went to take a turn and there she was, heading to my aunt's house and saw me walking. She honked the car horn, I looked for who it was and saw her. I'm sure some students get caught ditching, but not by their moms. It was my first time, I thought it was going to be as easy as people make it seem. I honestly thought I was going to get away with it, at least until I got home and have one of the guidance teachers call my mom. But um yeah, it's kind of a fun memory to think about. "
