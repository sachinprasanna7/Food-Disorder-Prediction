eRisk2023-T3_Subject22," b'personal mini-essay on my experience being aro (excuse the ending, im planning on putting it on my personal instagram as a coming out haha)' ", b'2021-10-26 01:35:51' , reddit post ," b""In a world so romance-centered, it can be incredibly difficult to even realize that you are aromantic. The narrative of \xe2\x80\x9cfinding the one\xe2\x80\x9d and marriage/a dating life being equated to success can make someone feel like they *need* to find a partner. The fact that there is little to no aromantic representation in media, and the fact that this lgbtq+ identity is hardly ever talked about in lgbtq+ discussions can make you unaware that this identity even exists. Once you realize that you are aromantic, it can be incredibly frustrating and isolating to live in a world so incredibly focused on something that is not even the slightest part of your life. It\xe2\x80\x99s in every song, every movie has it in some sort of focal plot, it\xe2\x80\x99s a huge focus in everyone else's life except yours. It can make someone feel broken, or like they need to be \xe2\x80\x9cfixed.\xe2\x80\x9d Then, once someone discovers that you\xe2\x80\x99re aromantic, you\xe2\x80\x99re met with \xe2\x80\x9care you sure you just haven\xe2\x80\x99t found the right person yet?\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cyou must be so lonely!\xe2\x80\x9d I promise you, I am incredibly happy on my own, and I have found the right person. I am the right person for me. I do not need to be fixed. \n\nFinding out that I was aromantic took a while. I identified as a lesbian for the longest time because I thought that if I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t attracted to men, I must be attracted to women, right? I had had all these \xe2\x80\x9ccrushes\xe2\x80\x9d on people, however they mysteriously went away as soon as we became closer friends. Turns out, you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be attracted to anyone, and those crushes I had were actually just me really wanting to be this person's friend. Looking back at my constant disinterest in dating, this should\xe2\x80\x99ve been more evident to me. Ever since I was 10, I just couldn\xe2\x80\x99t really wrap my head around the desire for life-long partnership. It sounded exhausting! There was even a point where I called myself a \xe2\x80\x9cpassive lesbian\xe2\x80\x9d because I had no desire to have a romantic partner, but I still thought girls were pretty. News flash! You can still think people look good without being attracted to them. \n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m writing this after a long afternoon of me getting incredibly more and more frustrated with the complete lack of understanding of aromanticism, so I apologize for how completely unorganized this is. My thoughts are not organized. I think that aromanticism is one of the most forgotten about and misunderstood identities out there, so if you have any questions, I am completely open to any of them. With such little information out there, it can be hard to understand. And, if you think you may be aromantic, you are not broken, you do not need to be fixed :)"" "
