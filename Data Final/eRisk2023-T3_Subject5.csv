She told me 2 weeks ago that if I wanted to say goodbye, I should go. It's about a 6.5 hour drive, and I stayed with my parents for the weekend I was there. I had a super candid conversation with my parents about how bad my health anxiety has been since the omicron wave. I made it super clear I do not want to become ill. The conversation actually left me feeling good - like they were actually listening to my concerns and didn't dismiss them.\n\nLast week my grandma died. My mom asked for my support and help to clean out her apartment. I made the long drive back. The night I arrived my dad casually mentioned he hadn't been going out for walks because he wasn't feeling well. I noticed some cough and cold medicine in their bathroom and asked about it. Apparently my mom has also had a cough for some time. I asked why they didn't tell me that they were both feeling ill. My mom's response was that she didn't want to tell me because she knew I wouldn't have gone if I'd known they were sick. \n\nThat comment left me totally stunned. I can't believe after our conversation the week prior that they'd wilfully withhold that information from me. I am so angry, and so hurt. I don't know if they have COVID.

If I can forgot about it for a bit while I\'m doing the thing, then there\'s a good chance it\'s anxiety.\n\nTriggers - did I see or hear something that may have trigger this feeling? For example, I know that seeing a fictional character in a tv show have a stroke triggered something in me a few weeks ago.\n\nSituation - was I in a physical situation that caused this physical sensations? For example, it\'s cold where I live so I bundle up, which can sometimes leave me feeling constricted around the neck and chest. I know that once I get inside I can take off the layers and the feeling will go away. Or if I have a pain in my back, maybe it\'s just because I slept super weird last night and not something terrible.\n\nThese things don\'t automatically make the anxiety go away, but they help me gain some perspective and at least ""observe"" me feelings.\n\nI hope you find some rest through what you\'re going through.'

After my 2nd and 3rd, I had some pretty swollen lymph nodes, which I know can be a pretty big health anxiety trigger for some folks -- that'll go away in a few days.\n\nIt sounds like the anxiety you experiences after your first shot was exhausting, and I'm really sorry you went through that for so long. Remind yourself of the thoughts and feelings that are real/true, and which are false. Prepare some healthy distractions that bring you joy or peace to help occupy your mind in the days following your vaccine.\n\nWhile I will admit to having had some anxiety about the vaccines (my parents are anti vaxxers and I've been steeped in that rhetoric), the vaccine anxiety was much much less than the anxiety that would surely result if I actually got COVID without some level of protection. \n\nMost importantly, take care of yourself, in every way you need to.""

The ache in my chest exacerbated the anxiety, and it became this feedback loop. It seems like wearing a bra makes the soreness worse. My doctor found nothing wrong with my heart or lungs, and an x-ray didn't show anything out of the ordinary.
