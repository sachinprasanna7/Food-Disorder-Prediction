eRisk2022-T3_Subject5,, 2021-09-18 02:12:51 , reddit post ," 1. I just freeze it all at once. Repeated freeze thaw cycles don’t seem to hurt it since it’s liquid.  Just make sure you give it a good stir before you use it.

2. Depends on the recipe, but usually about 125 grams for 500 grams of ice cream total (about a pint). So I’ll use ~125 g fruit purée and ~375 g ice cream or sherbet base.

3. Yes, I personally don’t like frozen banana chunks. Also it won’t churn well with chunks. If you want to add mix ins it’s better to stir them in after you churn. If you want to use the banana chunks as a mix in I’d make an extra that you can add in at the end. So basically make double the roasted banana: half to steep in the base and discard, half to use as a mix-in at the end. You can also purée the banana and add it to the base, but the extra starches can change the ice cream texture. I’ve personally never tried that, but there are plenty of recipes that use the purée method. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject5,, 2021-09-17 23:59:32 , reddit post ," I make simple cooked fruit purées with in season fruits then freeze them to use in ice cream throughout the year. My basic method is to peel/chop/mash the fruit, simmer about 10 minutes on the stove, purée, then strain out the seeds and pulp.

For all fruits except banana I add the purée at the time of churning. Just whisk it into your base right before you churn. For banana I like to do the steep overnight method: cook the base, add banana chunks to cooked base and refrigerate overnight. The next morning strain out the banana chunks and churn the ice cream. "

As a former gymnastics coach and current aerial arts instructor I would never agree to spot in a backyard. In addition to the obvious safety and equipment concerns, you also have insurance concerns.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject5,, 2021-08-29 23:18:46 , reddit post ," Does the studio actually penalize other students who are late? If they’re unevenly enforcing the rule, and you’ve been affected by that, then feel free to complain to the management about it, but if anyone who’s late still gets let in, or you’ve never been locked out for being late, it’s not really your place to complain.

As an instructor, yes I prefer my students to be on time, but I’d be really bothered if a student tried to complain about other student’s tardiness on my behalf. It’s really none of their business. Shit happens, as long as you aren’t disruptive when you come in and you take a few extra minutes to fully warm up in it’s not a big deal.

The monopolizing teacher time is tricky. I feel like you can try to talk to your instructor about this, but the chances that they can do anything about it are minimal. Part of this is that the instructor needs to set expectations about when is appropriate to ask for feedback (i.e. if I’m watching or spotting someone else, don’t interrupt me. If a student does interrupt I usually say something like “I’m watching X right now. I’ll help you next.” To highlight that they need to wait.) Also sometimes the instructor knows the student is annoying to others, but can’t really do anything about it since they aren’t doing anything unsafe. As for asking other advanced students to teach her, unless she asks you, it’s not your problem. Either the instructor will address it if it bothers them, or the students she’s asking can bring it up with the instructor. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject5,, 2021-08-09 04:00:16 , reddit post ," I’d recommend looking for local pole dance, aerial, or circus schools. All three should offer flexibility classes. Eventually you can move on to contortion classes which work on tricks at the more extreme ranges of flexibility. You can also look for flow arts (fire dancing, poi, hoop dancing) which are similar to the apparatus manipulation in rhythmic gymnastics. I’ve never seen flow arts classes in my area, it seems to be a more community-based thing with jams advertised on Facebook groups or through word of mouth in the circus community. Your local circus schools might be able to direct you to some good resources if you’re interested in that.

Also as a former gymnast turned pole dancer I totally recommend trying pole. "

Tempeh is also a great meat substitute. It has a nice mild nutty flavor and good texture. I’ve marinated it to make “bacon” (doesn’t really taste like bacon, but has a similar smokiness). Barbecue marinated tempeh is also good. I really like to cook it in Asian recipes in place of meat. It goes great with sweet and sour.

Another good substitute is lentils. I make a red lentil cacciatore and a green lentil fesenjoon.

Barbecue cauliflower is also a classic. I do it the lazy way where you just steam the cauliflower in the microwave and dip it in the sauce.

For Mexican style dishes I usually use beans as a substitute. I made great tacos the other day with red onion, broad beans, spices, lime, and cilantro. Black beans and pinto beans are of course the classic go-tos. "

My flexibility wasn’t great, but I worked really hard at it and eventually achieved moderate oversplits on both sides. It’s really about the effort you put into it.

I wanted it replaced but my new dentist wouldn’t do it bc in his words “it would fall out in six months”...sure...the first one only lasted 7 years... anyway I got used to the chip then when I was 16 he randomly started grinding it down without anesthetic or asking me first. This was during a cleaning. He then had the nerve to try and charge for it. He had to go back and grind my other front tooth too so that they would line up (it was a fairly large corner chip). Worst part is my tooth is still slanted because it was impossible to grind away the whole chip.

I’ve made ice cream with loose leaf tea in the past and it turned out super well, but I’m not sure if the concentrate is too watery to add to a base.

My thought is that I’d reduce the concentrate (it’s about 15% sugar, 85% water) until it’s thick and syrupy and add this too the base. I’m concerned this might mess with the flavor though. I’ve heard tea gets bitter if steeped too long or reheated, but I’m not sure that would apply to already cooked concentrate.

Another thought is to replace some of the milk in my base with milk powder and add the concentrate with out reducing. The thought is that milk powder+water from concentrate would serve as “milk”.

Has anyone had success with tea concentrates in the past?

As a side note, the day I realized my coach was abusive was so liberating.

2. I didn’t really like meat. I think it’s gross to cook, most of it didn’t taste great, and the meat stuff in the college dining hall was just gross.

3. I like animals and don’t like killing for no reason. Hunting and fishing for fun have always bothered me. As a kid I used to cry l when I saw the taxidermy hunting trophies.

4.(This is the not so good reason) Purging meat was gross. This wasn’t my only reason. Purging cheese was gross too, but I didn’t give that up. But if I’m being honest, this was part of the reason I went veggie. So, while it was a mostly ED free choice to go vegetarian, it wasn’t entirely. Not that I think that means I shouldn’t have done it. I just think it’s important to be careful. Make sure you’ll still be in recovery if you switch and that this isn’t just a choice to perpetuate your disorder.

I encourage you to honestly evaluate your reasons for going vegetarian. Only you can answer if it’s because of your eating disorder. Even if it’s not part of your eating disorder it’s important to check that it won’t make your disorder worse. For example, I tried to go vegan (for honest animal rights reasons), but I found myself obsessing and feeling guilty over food and it started to trigger ED behaviors. So, my balance is vegetarian is fine for me, but vegan is too far, at least for my current state of recovery. Protecting your health is important. It doesn’t make you a bad person if you can’t go vegetarian or vegan or whatever because it would hurt your mental health. It’s like sometimes having to take a pill with gelatin in it because you need the medication.

Sorry for the long ramble! I got interrupted a few times while typing this. I hope everything works out for you! "

-Morningstar Spicy Black Bean Burger

-Trader Joe’s Thai Chili Veggie Burger

-Amy’s All American Veggie Burger

-Hilary’s World’s Nest Veggie Burger (this one is really good, but doesn’t really have any protein)

-Amy’s Veggie Meatballs

-Field Roast Apple Maple Breakfast Sausage

Other protein sources:

-Tempeh: I slice it super thin and marinate it (BBQ, SweetandSour, Liquid smoke and other spices for “bacon”, etc) it absorbs flavors super well. I either pan fry it or broil it, so it gets nice and crispy. I like it better than tofu because it has a way better texture.

-Chickpeas (these go with anything really)

-Lentils (for simple you can just boil then mix in oil and whatever seasoning you like)

-Beans (can be used as a meat sub in chili/stews/soups, black beans with some garlic and cumin are good in tacos)

-Edamame (good lazy meal, microwave and toss with sweet chili sauce or use in Asian inspired pasta dishes)

If you like to cook I really recommend trying Ethiopian and Indian dishes. "

To ease yourself into elbow grip you can practice in a climb position. Position your legs like you would for a basic climb, extend your legs up and hook your elbow, then bend your knees so that more of your weight is resting in your elbow.

Make sure you mix all the dry ingredients together before adding so they don’t clump. I like to add them after the liquid ingredients have had a little time to heat, so they incorporate better. There’s also less risk of clumping if you whisk as you pour them in. Weigh the base after cooking and add back whatever water was lost (not strictly necessary, but I prefer the result). Chill in an ice bath then refrigerate overnight prior to churning.

I recommend playing around with different base recipes and adjusting them to your liking until you have a good basic sweet cream ice cream you like.

I found it didn’t prevent iciness very well. With locust bean gum I can leave my ice creams in the freezer for a couple weeks before they get icy, but with xanthan gum they get icy in a couple days.

The one thing I prefer xanthan gum for is uncooked sorbets. Locust bean gum has to reach fairly high temperatures to activate, so you have to cook whatever you’re making. If you’re making ice cream, or a sorbet from fruits that cook well (like peaches) it’s fine. However, for stuff like kiwi sorbet that I’d rather not cook, xanthan gum is a better choice.

Also some brands don’t even sell an XS size.

For tops my biggest concern is whether my nipples show. I want padding (not like crazy push-up padding, but just enough to prevent exposure) like in swimsuits. Just double lining is not enough.

Eating disorders are complex since they’re caused by a mix of genetics and environmental factors, so everyone has different things that work for them. I think it’s possible that some of these people made the choice to go vegan for the wrong reasons then later managed to recover in spite of initial choosing it as a socially acceptable way to restrict. I also tend to think that even if someone is only partially recovered, it’s better than nothing. I’m also hesitant to write it off as not true recovery because I did some unorthodox things to recover myself. I actually found it helpful to weigh myself during weight restoration, since my during my ED I wasn’t actively trying to lose weight and I don’t have issues with body dysmorphia. However, I would never recommend that to someone else because it could be really harmful. I guess that’s what bothers me about the whole vegan diet cures ED thing...sure it may work for a few people, but the majority of ED sufferers will be harmed by that type of restriction. "

I do what I can while protecting my own health. For example, I actually prefer soy milk and almond milk to cows milk, so that’s what I drink. I eat vegan protein bars because I like them just as much as normal ones, so I don’t feel like I’m depriving myself. "

They have a bunch of levels ranging from level 1 (no inverts) to professional. There’s also different categories depending on what kind of style you prefer for your routine. Competitions are all over the US, plus one in Canada and one in Europe, so you can hopefully find one close to you!

Edit: Tips

1. Relax! Remember that you’re doing this for fun, so don’t take it too seriously and stress yourself out.

2. Start early. I like much prefer to have time to run my full piece and get endurance up in the weeks immediately prior to competition/showcase rather than finishing it last minute. You’ll feel more comfortable if you’ve done it a million times before you get on the stage.

3. You don’t have to do every trick you know. Pick ones that you like, go well with the music, and make interesting combos. I had to take one of my favorite combos out of my last routine because it just wasn’t flowing with the music and that’s okay, my routine was better for it.

4. Pick a song you really like AND feel like you can dance to. There’s songs I enjoy and then there’s the songs I enjoy that are pole-able. Pick one that fits your dance style.

5. Get other people to critique your routine, especially if there’s people at your studio who’ve competed or judged before. Outside perspective helps a lot.

6. Film your run throughs, even if it’s just free styling to your song. It helps to know if that move you think looks really cool in your head is actually super awkward. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject5,, 2017-10-31 19:43:23 , reddit post ," I’ve never been big into cardio, but I have traded weightlifting for acrobatics/calisthenics. I did gymnastics for 13 years, quit midway through college due to life shit. I picked up weightlifting a few months after I quit with some yoga on the side to keep up with my flexibility and handstand strength. About a year and a half ago I found pole dancing which totally satisfies my acrobatic side, so I’ve lowered the amount of time I lift so I can pole more. I also recently started partner acrobatics, so I dropped another day of lifting to accommodate that.

Pros: acrobatics and pole is way more fun imo, learning new tricks is a lot more satisfying than increasing weight. Plus, I can compete at pole and actually enjoy it.

Cons: my butt is no longer getting bigger. When I was weightlifting more my butt grew a lot, but now I’ve just been maintaining it. "

1/2 onion, minced

Olive oil

2 egg whites (can also use 1 whole egg or an egg sub)

Tomato paste (can also use tomato sauce)

Salt

Pepper

Italian seasoning

1. Sauté the onion and garlic in olive oil.

2. Mix 2 tbsp tomato paste with small amount of water until you get a saucy consistency. (You can also just use tomato sauce. I always have cans of tomato paste on hand, so this way is more convenient for me).

3. Mix together onion, garlic, ground seitan, and egg. Add tomato sauce 1 tbsp at a time until it reaches the right consistency. It should somewhat hold together. If it's too moist you can add in bread crumbs. Season liberally with Italian seasoning, salt and pepper.

4. Bake at 350 until knife comes out clean (30min to 1hr 30 min depending on pan. I like to use 4 mini loaf pans and make individual mini meatloaves.)

Wed-yoga, dinner, pole 1 hr
Thurs-lift 2hrs in AM, rock climbing 1.5 hrs PM
Fri-run 20 min and 1 hr yoga in afternoon
Sat-light yoga (active rest)

It does get a bit strenuous at times. I find every 2-3 weeks I need to take a rest day. I go by how my body feels and whether my progress is suffering when judging if I should take a rest day or just do a lighter workout.

Sunday-lift 1.5 hrs, pole dance 1 hr

I don't recommend lifting twice since your muscles need time to recover so they get stronger. I suggest active recovery like LISS cardio or yoga (I like vinyasa for the harder workout). Here's what I do:

Sun-yoga

Mon-lift AM, aerial yoga PM

Tues-run AM, yoga PM

Wed-lift AM, pole dance PM

Thurs- Rest, sometimes include a restorative yoga session

Fri-lift

Sat-run and pole AM, yoga PM

If you're lucky it's not lactose intolerance, though, but you're body down regulating the production of lactase (the enzyme needed to digest lactose) due to not needing it lately. If this is the case, you can slowly introduce lactose into your diet in small amounts until you get back to normal. If it's truly intolerance I recommend investing in Lactaid. It's basically just a dose of the enzyme that your body isn't producing. As someone who's lactose intolerant, it's wonderful.

What I've found to work for me is to keep my schedule for eating the same (I have a snack at 3:45 and eat dinner at 6:30 on normal days), but to decrease the amount of food I eat. On workout days I will usually eat something like fruit with 1 tbsp of nut butter and 1/2 c of fruit juice or almond milk for dinner. Then I take a cup of milk or soy milk (make sure it's a kind with high protein content) with me to drink after the workout  to replenish carbs and get a little protein in. If I'm hungry during I'll sip on the milk. Later at night around 10:30 or so I'll have a protein shake and 1/4 c icecream plus a tbsp nuts. I'm not really sure what a good replacement for protein shakes is, but I like it as an easy way to get in extra protein and calories without eating a ton of food.

Sprint/jog

Squat jumps/squat hold (like chair sit but without the wall)

Handstand push-ups/handstand hold (I use a wall bc I can't hold more than a two-minute handstand, especially with the push-ups added in)

Burpees/plank

V-ups/hollow hold

Body weight glute bridge/hold at top

Double unders/regular jump rope

Another thing I sometimes do is 30 sec intervals with no rest, but switching exercises each time to target a different body part. So something like lunges (30 sec each leg), push-ups, v-ups, squat jumps, dips(off the edge of a bench), Russian twists, etc. It gets really tiring cardio-wise without the break period, but you can go for a decently long time, since you're not killing the same muscle all at once.
