Also ask if you can have the test done lying down. That's what I usually do and it helps a lot with avoiding fainting. Also when it's happening don't look at your arm and try to focus really hard on something else - could be chatting with the nurse or I usually do counting in another language in my head. Good luck!""

I can understand why people didn\'t like it though.\n\nI thought Effy getting into insider trading did fit reasonably well with her character and we could see she was still controlling the men around her. I can even accept Naomi turning from a right-on political activist into a slacker but I just hated her cancer storyline. What with that and Effy going to prison it was just way way too bleak! I don\'t know why Skins is so obsessed with killing off their characters.\n\nI also felt like Naomi and Emily were both kind of harsh on Effy, like when Emily slaps her at the airport. I don\'t think we find out who told Emily about Naomi\'s cancer in the end but I felt it was a bit unfair of her to say ""You stole this time with her from me!!"" Effy did tell Naomi she should tell Emily and Naomi refused to, so what was Effy meant to do? Go behind Naomi\'s back? That\'s honestly a really difficult situation for someone to be in and whatever you do, somebody is going to get hurt. Plus Effy looked after Naomi and paid the rent for her but Naomi was still kind of rude to her. I felt like Effy was doing her best but she was just out of her depth and naturally a less warm person than Dom.\n\nSo anyway, I would ditch the cancer plot but keep the insider trading. Maybe instead we could have had Effy living with Pandora or Katie, or Naomi still having cancer but starting to recover at the end (it was implied if not outright stated she wasn\'t going to make it).

I think James did a good job portraying his vulnerable moments.\n\nBlake Harrison (Neil) is a very close second as I saw an interview with him and was genuinely shocked that he is actually very articulate and Neil's voice isn't his actual accent. He does a great job of playing a character who is very dimwitted but also loveable.\n\nSimon Bird (Will) does a fantastic job with Will's expressions and exasperated moments but I do feel like he plays basically the same character as Adam in Friday night dinner. However I remember reading somewhere he prefers stand up and doesn't actually like acting, plus FND is legendary so we can let him off.\n\nJoe Thomas (Simon) probably the weakest of the 4 in my opinion but it's by an incredibly small margin. I just find his delivery a bit awkward sometimes.\n\nDishonourable mentions: honestly on the whole I think the show has great acting across the board but I have to mention Emily Head (Carli), a fair amount of her lines are very wooden and awkward sounding.

The right is more constant but pretty quiet; the left is usually louder but sometimes stops completely. I spoke to my Dr who assumed it was wax so I tried using drops but nothing happened. Got my ears checked and they were clear of wax and my hearing is fine. Spoke to Dr again and asked to change my medication (sertraline) as tinnitus can be a side effect of it but I'm now 3 weeks into a different one and it hasn't made any difference.  \n\n\nI just have no idea why it's happening to me as I don't listen to loud music, don't work in construction, very rarely go to clubs and am not a big concert-goer. I've been to about 6 concerts in my life and they were all quite spaced out time-wise, plus I never experienced any hearing issues immediately after them. What is more, since March this year I've just been at home doing bugger all because of corona. I always thought T affected mainly older people. Has anyone else experienced something similar and if so, did you find anything that helped?"" "

Skip to end for TL;DR.\n\n​\n\nA bit of background: I\'m British and met my Korean boyfriend aka the love of my life when he was studying English here in the UK. He went back to Korea in September last year so we\'ve been doing the LDR thing since then. Over Christmas he came to see me and then we spent some time in Korea together.\n\n​\n\nEarlier this month he started his military service and I can\'t message him on LINE, our usual method of communication, because apparently you can\'t use phones during training. He had told me about this website [http://www.katc.mil.kr/katc/community/children.jsp](http://www.katc.mil.kr/katc/community/children.jsp) and I\'d been waiting for it to update with the newest bunch of recruits, but when it did I couldn\'t sign up as it asked me to select my phone provider. Since I don\'t live in Korea the answer was obviously ""none of them"" and that was as far as it got.\n\nOkay fine, onto Plan B. I did some online sleuthing and found an email for BF\'s dad who told me to try [http://www.thecamp.or.kr/](http://www.thecamp.or.kr/) instead. Thank you Jesus, I managed to sign up to this one but my Korean is not good - when I try to get onto the ""write a letter"" bit a popup pops up saying I have to ""join the education camp"" according to Google Translate and I can\'t for the life of me figure out how to do that...\n\nSo onto Plan C - I spent an embarrassing amount of time looking up how to access the Korean app store so I could download the The Camp app as the PC site seems to be still under development. Eventually I got it all downloaded onto my phone but when I tried to login with my ID which I registered using the PC version...GUESS WHAT. We hit another brick wall ladies and gents. It wants SMS verification. Nothing came through using my number, presumably because it\'s a UK and not a Korean number, even with the country code +44 at the start. I also tried using an online SMS retrieval service but only one of them had a Korean number available and whatever format I used for the number still nothing came through.\n\n​\n\nTL;DR - am foreign and despite best efforts can\'t get in touch with BF doing army service.\n\n​\n\nHas anyone here been in a similar situation or could anyone whose Korean is good help me navigate The Camp website? Unfortunately I haven\'t got any other Korean friends whose number I could use to pick up the SMS verification code. I\'m happy to provide proof that I\'m not pulling some kind of weird scam, I just miss my boyfriend terribly and want to send him a message to let him know I\'m thinking of him.\n\nUpdate: a very kind user let me use their phone number to pick up the verification code for The Camp but clearly the Korean military is already onto me, it kept saying ""time has expired or incorrect code"" so guess we can rule that one out sad emoji\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​\n\n​' "

Sometimes the glue contains animal products too I've heard. I appreciate this probably isn't a common concern, but just wondered has anyone else been in this situation, and what should I do? Just buy some anyway because there's not really an alternative maybe? Someone in a group I'm in on FB had the same problem with figure skates and was forced to buy leather ones. I did find that Grishko will apparently do you a shoe with a vegan sole but if the model doesn't suit my foot shape etc that's still no good."" "

I need to send home a lot of clothes/books etc. but the boxes the post office has are too small. I still have the one my parents used to send the stuff out here which is approx 50cmx50cmx50cm but is too bashed up to use again.

A comment had been made on the OP about this update but I thought someone should make a separate post.\n\nAtsumi Yoshikubo was a 45-year-old Japanese woman who went missing while on holiday in Canada in October 2014. Foul play was ruled out and it was suspected she had most likely committed suicide. In 2015 some of her personal belongings were found by a hiker along with bone fragments. Last week it was announced that forensic tests determined the remains belonged to Ms Yoshikubo, but due to the state of the remains an autopsy could not be performed.\n\n[Source](http://bnonews.com/news/index.php/news/id4104)\n\n[Link to the OP](https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/3xu7q5/disappearance_of_atsumi_yoshikubo/)\n\n[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disappearance_of_Atsumi_Yoshikubo)' "

I'm pretty flexible but can only just hit splits when leaping, also don't get very far off the ground. I'm going back to RG soon and want to get my turning split leap so let me know if you have any advice! Thank you :)"" "
