You guys you can meditate! You\xe2\x80\x99re feeling things inside you! You can tell one feeling/energy from another and not with words! Oh my that sounds like wonders to me.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99ve came to realize however that I\xe2\x80\x99m identifying more than I think with my problems. I\xe2\x80\x99ve always known myself as a troubled person (I was and I am, so to speak), the thing is it\xe2\x80\x99s became like an unshakable part of \xe2\x80\x9cme\xe2\x80\x9d. And that\xe2\x80\x99s a neutral way to put it. What\xe2\x80\x99s even harder to admit to myself is that I\xe2\x80\x99m somehow getting pleasure from an identification as such. Like every time I read about depression/anxiety/suicidal thoughts, I feel an itch scratched deep down in me, a shameful itch like in unspeakable parts, and it\xe2\x80\x99s now gently scratched. It\xe2\x80\x99s exhilarating even. Of course we know as a common sense that scratching an itch would probably revive it and make it worse, but I noticed the moment of satiation whenever such topics were brought up, and then followed by more overwhelming urges that I can\xe2\x80\x99t really describe (like yay ahahaaahaha now let\xe2\x80\x99s scratch that skin to the bones!).\n\nSo I saw in these reactions how deeply I\xe2\x80\x99m identifying with the troubled part of me, and I think it\xe2\x80\x99s going to do me no good. How can I get rid of the old thought pattern, that has seated me in the role of \xe2\x80\x9cmentally disturbed\xe2\x80\x9d? I\xe2\x80\x99ve found Tolle very helpful. I\xe2\x80\x99d prefer not to read on some general introduction into the theories, and I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for some more \xe2\x80\x9cpractical\xe2\x80\x9d (if that\xe2\x80\x99s the right word) guidance. Any recommendations please? Love and peace to you all!\n\nEdit/tldr: I spoke about the main obstacle for me at the moment but I\xe2\x80\x99m really asking for recommendations! Like what authors should I be looking into or what practices I might consider doing, since I\xe2\x80\x99m a definite newbie here. I\xe2\x80\x99ve been searching ofc and actually got a loooooong list noted but (pardon me for this), it\xe2\x80\x99s just too overwhelming, almost leaves me as perplexed as always, and it feels distant.

Please bear with me a little.\n\nTo make this thing easier I\xe2\x80\x99m going to put out the facts first.\n\nDemographic facts: I\xe2\x80\x99m 26 years old, female, Chinese, can assuredly be found in Shanghai till June 2023, when I\xe2\x80\x99m expected to finish graduate studies.\n\nBetter-to-know-at-first facts:\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m really uncomfortable in any kind of sexual intercourse, I know it\xe2\x80\x99s a community for asexual people but no harm mentioning.\n\nI would by no means bear children and it\xe2\x80\x99s not negotiable, having a human being grow inside me is beyond my wildest horror, and after all, bringing new life to this world is against my ethics.\n\nI smoke and I\xe2\x80\x99m not proud of it, but well it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to change and I don\xe2\x80\x99t see any good reason to, not yet.\n\nI have a long history of mental issues, mostly eating disorder and depression, got the bipolar diagnosis once but I think the doctor was mistaken. I won\xe2\x80\x99t say that I\xe2\x80\x99ve outgrown that history, but I\xe2\x80\x99m indeed getting stronger, why, I\xe2\x80\x99m writing an ad looking for partner now, you bet I want some good things in life.\n\nLet\xe2\x80\x99s see what else is looking bad on me\xe2\x80\xa6. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think I left many stones unturned, maybe I forgot something but later. Now there\xe2\x80\x99s something about me that cannot be shown by facts:\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not religious, but definitely not atheist. I\xe2\x80\x99m very interested in religions (especially Buddhism) and spiritual practices.\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m currently learning German, at first it\xe2\x80\x99s because I wanted to go for the vocational training in Germany, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve been told that it\xe2\x80\x99s not such a good idea. But still, German is a beautiful language! I began by reading Kafka\xe2\x80\x99s Ein Landarzt, which has been my favorite for years, then I ventured to read Also sprach Zarathustra which was such a pleasure at first, until Zarathustra spoke of going to women with a whip. Why, if Nietzsche had the fame of the great misogynist like Schopenhauer did, I won\xe2\x80\x99t be as much disappointed, but most people only know him as the mad guy crying for a dead horse which makes his profile kind of loving. I actually cried like a broken hearted lover, why Zarathustra why, I love your teachings so much and you only want to whip me??? My recent reading is Das Ich und das Es, it\xe2\x80\x99s such a shame that the I and the it should be translated into the ego and the id which complicated everything.\n\n(please ignore those nosense above) I\xe2\x80\x99m interested in psychoanalysis, literature (as I\xe2\x80\x99m a student of literature), language learning and philosophy, those are my \xe2\x80\x9cfancy\xe2\x80\x9d hobbies.\n\nMy \xe2\x80\x9cnot so fancy\xe2\x80\x9d hobbies are thrillers, horror stories, true crimes, basically anything that gives you a chill on the spine, or a turn in the guts. I\xe2\x80\x99m kind of a daredevil at times (which means when I\xe2\x80\x99m not too lazy to move), and enjoy doing dangerous or unusual things just for the fun of it. I went to visit the cemetery at night because I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t sleep, made a ladder myself from shelves and chair to climb into my dorm window on the second floor when I didn\xe2\x80\x99t have keys, and I can ride a bike with hands off! Ah those are happy moments!\n\nI\xe2\x80\x99m not sure which city I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be in after I graduate, hopefully I find a job in Europe, hopefully.\n\nWhat I\xe2\x80\x99m looking for is some serious, long-term relationship. I know you can\xe2\x80\x99t push such things and serious commitments are intimidating, but I speak of the ideal case scenario, and maybe in a very long time. What I forgot to mention above is that I\xe2\x80\x99m also extremely introvert, I have no friends in life, barely some acquaintances, because most times I\xe2\x80\x99d just keep to myself, how could you expect to make friends like that? But really, social with people even people you like is exhausting. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know if the metaphor is inappropriate but my want for long committed relationship is kind of like choosing good tv series (once chosen you get to watch for months even years) over good films, I want company and I don\xe2\x80\x99t like the trying and choosing period, I want to find someone and stick to the choice.\n\nWell I can\xe2\x80\x99t really say what I expect in you\xe2\x80\xa6 basically anyone who\xe2\x80\x99s still reading here, and is interested, or have any further questions, please feel free to contact me.'

I'm going to graduate in 2023 with MA in French language and literature. I've been thinking a lot on what I'm going to do and what I know for sure is that I hate teaching (as much as I suck at it so no regrets), and that I'm a horrible, horrible procrastinator (I basically can never meet the deadline for my assignments and such behavior hardly changed no matter how bad the consequenses). I also believed for a long time that I'd better look for less people interactions because I'm extremely introvert, easily stressed and have a history with really bad mental problems. So I thought there could be literally no possible job at all for me.  \n\nLately though my mind has changed. I realized that my true stressor does not come from the outside world, and it's certainly not interaction with people that I fear. Actually I get the worst anxiety when I'm forcing myself to do the work that I (God knows why) procrastinate... I think maybe I'm just bad at work that are assigned to me with a deadline, and I be the master of my time in between as long as I get the work done is my nightmare scenario. On the contrary if there's no time in between, if what the work requires is instant reaction and even improvisation, I think I can do just fine. I remember on my last year in college I worked for two weeks as an interpretor in some florists seminar, and I actually enjoyed it. Now there are much fewer occasions as such due to the covid, but I think maybe there are similar jobs? No or very little assignements, lots of field work instead of sitting in the office? I really can't think of many jobs like this, God I know so little of what are the jobs out there in the world! Any suggestions please?"" "

Ich bin sehr verwirrt, also haben Sie bitte Verst\xc3\xa4ndnis f\xc3\xbcr mich.\n\nIch bin 26 Jahre alt, komme aus einem Nicht-EU-Land und mache 2023 meinen Master-Abschluss (in franz\xc3\xb6sischer Sprache und Literatur). Aus einigen Gr\xc3\xbcnden (nichts Illegales) habe ich vor Kurzem  beschlossen, mein Heimatland f\xc3\xbcr immer zu verlassen, und jetzt erw\xc3\xa4ge ich das Ausbildung.\n\nZun\xc3\xa4chst einmal m\xc3\xb6chte ich wissen, (nat\xc3\xbcrlich), welche Chancen ich h\xc3\xa4tte, eine Ausbildungsstelle zu finden. Versteht sich, dass ich als Ausl\xc3\xa4nderin (und ein bisschen zu alt daf\xc3\xbcr bin) weniger bevorzugt werde, aber wird es so sein, dass ich mich mehr anstrengen muss, um eine Stelle zu finden, oder ist es so gut wie unm\xc3\xb6glich? (Ich wei\xc3\x9f, dass das niemand sagen kann, aber bitte sprich einfach aus deiner Erfahrung oder was immer du denkst). Und ich nehme an, dass die Chancen je nach Fachgebiet unterschiedlich sind. Fallen Ihnen also Vorschl\xc3\xa4ge ein, welchen Studiengang man w\xc3\xa4hlen sollte? solche mit mehr offenen Stellen, die auf dem Arbeitsmarkt st\xc3\xa4rker nachgefragt werden (vielleicht weil Einheimische sie nicht w\xc3\xa4hlen) und daher eher von Ausl\xc3\xa4ndern eingestellt werden?\n\nEine andere Frage ist, ob die Ausbildungsverg\xc3\xbctung f\xc3\xbcr den Lebensunterhalt ausreicht... Ich habe auf einigen Websites gesehen, dass die Ausbildungsverg\xc3\xbctung ungef\xc3\xa4hr 800 Euro betr\xc3\xa4gt (das variiert auch sehr stark, aber ich spreche von der Allgemeinheit), reicht das zum Leben? und nat\xc3\xbcrlich meine ich ein sehr bescheidenes Leben. Wenn Sie von Azubis wissen oder geh\xc3\xb6rt haben, leben sie alleine oder brauchen sie noch famili\xc3\xa4re Unterst\xc3\xbctzung, um die Ausbildung zu absolvieren?\n\nIch wei\xc3\x9f, dass sehr gute Deutschkenntnisse erforderlich sind, ich habe bereits angefangen zu lernen und habe nat\xc3\xbcrlich nicht die Absicht, mit weniger als flie\xc3\x9fendem Deutsch nach Deutschland zu gehen.\n\nVielen Dank f\xc3\xbcr Ihre Geduld! und bitte \xc3\xbcberlegen Sie, mir zu antworten' "

So I don't think suicide can help, nor is it a terrible choice as many think, it just won't make much difference, as the exams won't go away just bc you did, you surely have to face them again as long as you didn't pass.""
