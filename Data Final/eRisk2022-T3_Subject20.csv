When I was 13-14  my pediatrician said I should weigh in the teens (110-118) and lose some weight; I was 135lb. Oh and when we had to calculate our BMI in gym class and share it with the class. Mine said ""overweight."" Just a little but that was enough. In front of everyone.

It wasn't a harmful thing for my pediatrician to say and I was predisposed, there were plenty of other signs in hindsight, but it sure stuck with me along with a crippling eating disorder for 9 years (ongoing, recovery is hard).

eRisk2022-T3_Subject20,, 2020-08-26 20:44:48 , reddit post ," This has a charming style to it, I like it!
My advice would be to work on perspective with the limbs - the cat's feet (mainly the hindlegs, but front too) look a bit wonky and not exactly where they should be. Perhaps some quick sketched shadows around the cat's legs and feet to suggest positioning.

Also, proportions. Kitty's nose and mouth are very small compared to the eyes, which are too big for its head. If this is part of your style maybe try keeping the cartoony, sketched look while adding a bit of realism. The torso, too, and overall body shape are rather bulbous if you're aiming for a real-ish cat. There's not enough of a dip/curves for the tummy and hips, and the chest is too pronounced to keep with bone structure.

I like the simplicity and the gentle touch of the roses. It adds to the endearing, charming tone. Good job :) "

It's been 3 years and my heart still hurts to think of it. I could barely tell my mother once, ever, during a breakdown. She never mentioned it again.

I can't imagine the mix of emotions you feel whenever you see that tattoo...It wasn't malicious, but definitely tone-deaf and lacking in self-awareness. I know I can't really help but I'm sending my sympathies - it's a sensitive topic to broach. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject20,, 2020-08-23 06:17:23 , reddit post ," That's an interesting take. My parents were born in '47 and '55, I was born late '94. I identity more with the millennial gen stuff but at times I find myself using older, outdated terms and re-thinking them - as a kid I picked them up subconsciously, as kids tend to do. For example, all my life my father ('47) referred to Asian people as ""orientals."" I never called anyone that to their face but it took me until a few years ago to realize it can have racist implications. Same with ""colored."" Made sense to child me because color is literally just color, not something inherently good or bad. White is white, brown is brown, etc. Literal colors.

I hope that makes sense...other old phrases I've said I've had to explain to my peers or people younger than me, e.g. ""pig-headed"" meaning stubborn, among many others. My friends laughed at me when I said good bye to them as ""Always a pleasure!"" They told me I was like a grandma. "

That's part of the intense guilt, shame and embarrassment. Please be gentle and non-judgmental. As someone who struggled for years, of course this thought crossed my mind countless times. It's not that simple. It's painful, it hurts to be misunderstood, alienated and feel accused of something; it crushes your self-esteem because we know we're wasting everything.

I'm sorry to come off as harsh. It's great that you want to help your mom, but the way you talk about it lacks compassion or empathy. It's incredibly complicated to understand, but try to be more understanding. Do some research. If you make her feel awful about it or herself she might shut down. "

I've also been doing an IOP program for the last 2 months and it's helped as well, but as a person with depression, anxiety, bipolar 2 and an ED, meds have been vital for me.

So yes, you need to use a new glyph each time. For example, say I use glyph of the spectral wolf on my shaman's ghost wolf spell. That glyph is consumed. Then I decide to replace it with glyph of the spectral raptor. I need to get that glyph separately, then when I use it on my spell it overwrites the old glyph.

But later if I want spectral wolf back, I'd have to buy another glyph of the spectral wolf and repeat the process.

Swinging her head back and forth to look from side to side - it reminds me of a bird. And because she can't move her eyes on their own, sometimes it looks like she's staring at me/some part of the room when in reality, she was looking at something that just happens to be in that direction. Like...I'm to her right, and she wants to look at something to her right. Turns her head, eyes appear straight towards me. I think she can sort of ""wiggle"" them from side to side slightly, that's it.

I hate people staring at me, I've always been extremely self-conscious and somewhat paranoid. Once in a while it'll get to me and I'll tell her to stop staring and inevitably, she's not even looking at me. But it's always been this way with her (she's 26, I'm 24) so I'm just used to it. Don't notice most of the time, actually.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject20,, 2018-11-26 09:22:12 , reddit post ," This thread made me remember two specific incidents that strongly affected me, as a lifelong lover of writing:

1. I used to write in little journals as a kid. Diary type stuff, stories, drawings, the works. I had partially written a silly short story about my family as cats (I was 9). The journal had a pretty recognizable printed cover...anyway, one day I walked into the bathroom and there it was, on the shelf near the toilet, open to a page on which I'd drawn and described us as cats. Last I knew it was in my room. I was so incredibly embarrassed that even now it makes me feel slightly ashamed of the story's stupidity and imagining them laughing at it.


2. Again, I was 9-10. Different journal I think. I vividly recall writing about how empty I felt, how pointless and without meaning my life was. I expressed how I felt like there was a void inside of me that nothing could fill. I distinctly remember that line.

So, I was going up the stairs and I saw my father standing in front of my bedroom door, holding my journal up to that page. I don't remember what exactly he said to me, but he did refer to that line and his solution was to show me his Pogo books to help fill that void. Pogo as in the old (1950s?) comic book opossum. I didn't get it then and I don't get it now. Maybe because they made him feel better when he was a kid? I think he was trying to help in his own way.
Regardless, I felt deeply violated, confused, and displeased almost to the point of tears. It bothered me so much, and still does - but only now do I realize why.

Also, I didn't care for the comics and have struggled with major depression, self-esteem/confidence issues and anxiety my entire adolescence and adulthood. So no, Pogo didn't help. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject20,, 2018-11-12 17:10:03 , reddit post ," Hm, I think you have a good point. The Horde and the Alliance are not the same, they weren't built on the same foundation and they stood for their own thing. Not complete antitheses, but enough to create an interesting dichotomy such that when a player plays on either faction, the stories are unique and lend to an immersive experience.

Like...say I start on the Alliance. Okay, so I get a bit of backstory and tenuous understanding of what I'm doing this for. Maybe it even incites passion or faction pride - I remember it did in the begining, at least. Then I switch to Horde, and it's just as distinctive and, in theory, equally as interesting. I can get behind either faction, for their own reasons. That really should be the case for both sides...I want to be rooting for my faction, whichever it is, for a reason that I ""get,"" and support. I hope I'm getting my point across, I'm rambling a bit...

Now I'm uninterested in the story as a whole, especially Alliance. It's boring. Not unique, nothing special. Feels like it lost its identity. There's no unity. Sometimes it feels like I'm still playing the Horde, but with a pretty face instead. ""Stand as One"" sounds strong, proud, morale, and carries that sense of equality that the OP explained well.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject20,, 2018-11-05 05:39:54 , reddit post ," I have had two, both surgical vacuum aspiration. I found out I was pregnant a couple weeks after I turned 22 (Nov 2016). One night my boyfriend noticed that my breasts were larger...sure enough, they'd enlarged and swollen a bit. I hadn't noticed it myself even. Then, I realized my period was ~3 days late. Thought maybe it was just being irregular. But that coupled with my boobs...well, four positive tests later I was scared shitless. He shut down on me, I remember in the car on the way to buy the tests he just kept repeating ""I'm not gonna be a dad.""

The clinic was very nice and professional. The procedure wasn't bad...they gave me a big pill, had me wait an hour, then took me in and put me under twilight anesthesia. I remember the vacuum itself, a sensation of pressure, then done. Not really painful and it was over in minutes. I was loopy for a bit afterwards, and had cramps the following week. My boyfriend did come with me because I needed a driver, so at least I had some support the day of. I was barely 5 weeks along (Dec 2016).

I followed their post-care instructions intently. But I was still in a lot of abdominal pain for weeks after, and had intense sharp pains every time I went to the bathroom. I insisted on seeing the doctor again, I knew something was wrong. Everything I was reading online for a recovery timeline wasn't fitting - other women were fine in a couple weeks at most. I was in continuous, crippling pain for almost a month total.

The woman who gave me a quick inspection with her fingers didn't help at all. She was dismissive. That's literally all she did and it hurt like hell. So I called again, and said I wanted to see the actual gyno, the one who performed the surgery. Finally got in to see him. He actually listened, and gave me a smear. Ding, I had a UTI for the first time in my life. Okay, so they gave me antibiotics, cool. Here I'm going to mention that at the time of my procedure, they prescribed me bc pills, so I had been taking them for 2-3 weeks by now.

Well, the UTI cleared up in a week. So, that's my physical experience. Mentally, emotionally...I was a wreck. I had no one to talk to, not my family, no friends. My boyfriend just couldn't understand, even if he wanted to. I was so alone and going through emotions that I didn't know how to process. I cried all the time, I was depressed, ashamed, I was hurting. Eventually it simmered to a dull ache, but I burst into tears whenever I thought about it all.

3 months later. March 2017. Again my bf noticed bigger boobs. Same thing. Tgought about it  and figured out that the most probable case was that the antibiotics screwed with my bc. The timing added up right. Again I was terrified, again scheduled an appointment with the clinic. I was a bit more calm because I knew what to expect, more or less. I went by myself this time, even drove myself. I decided to have an IUD inserted and it was a great decision. No UTI this time, healed much faster. I bled for like 3 weeks but that was because of the IUD, it was more annoying than painful.

Mentally...similar story. Guilt, shame, sadness, grieving. Not as intense, but now I had the added shame of having two abortions in 3 months. I still feel that. It's deep. Only in the past few months have I gotten to the point where I don't cry incoherently whenever I think of it for a minute or two, and it's been almost 2 years.

I know I made the right decision. I was unfit to be the mother a child deserves; I was unemployed, mentally unstable, and taking drugs - that part got worse as time went on and I was messed up for a long time. I started therapy two months ago and am making baby steps. Starting to feel better, but it's slow.

It still aches to think back on it, but just barely. The emotional aftermath - the shame, depression, self-loathing, and guilt - however, never ceased. I still imagine my babies. What they'd look like, fictional scenarios, possible futures. Names I had already picked out. It makes me sad.

God, I don't know what would have happened if I didn't have insurance. The procedures were $80 co-pays and the IUD was fully covered. I am so thankful for that, and I'm afraid for all the women who don't have that luxury.

Sorry for the novel there...It's not something I've ever really talked to anyone about. It weighs heavily. "

Another non-hormonal BC is the ParaGard IUD. IUD's aren't for everyone, but they're 99.8% effective and last for 10 years! This one is a copper IUD, the only non-hormonal kind. I had one for 9 months and the first couple months I bled heavily and had 12 day periods, when mine are normally 5 days. But then my body adjusted and my periods returned to just about normal. It's also a good idea to ask them to trim the strings shorter if they are poking him (he'll know, it can hurt).

That's the main side effect of this IUD - making your periods heavy and/or longer. So if you already have bad periods or don't want one, it might not be for you. But otherwise, past the first couple months, it was great and I would have kept it in longer but it had started to expel itself.  "

I don't see what you did as unethical so much as smart business. You spent time and effort working to make those savvy deals happen. You made a few sacrifices of luxury, something that he's never had to face. He lacks perspective and is being narrow-minded.

When I have had manic episodes, the ""jittery"" sensation you mention feels like you have so many thoughts, racing so fast all around, jumbling together and you can't catch them. So it's like you start saying something and your mind goes faster than your mouth, and the trails of thought spill over and become disjointed. The thought that you started with never gets finished. None of them do.

The energy, the no need for sleep...to me it feels like all those thoughts that you can't catch are rushing under your skin like electricity - if you stop moving, stop going, your head will physically implode with it all.

People already have this HUGE misunderstanding about bipolar disorder and it carries a very negative, hurtful stigma. To me, misinforming people and conflating the two disorders perpetrates incorrect, negative stereotypes.

But yes, I totally agree that it sounds like she has borderline personality disorder. It's tough for everyone involved. People don't want to be like that; it's emotionally taxing, ruins interpersonal relationships and creates so much turmoil. Everyone around her suffers, but so does she.

Some medications can help with certain symptoms, such as antidepressants, mood stabilizers or antipsychotics, but the most important part of treatment for someone like that is intensive therapy. Long-term, intensive therapy. All the medication in the world isn't a substitute for proper psychotherapy. There are often co-morbid mental illnesses present along with bpd, complicating it even further. It takes time and support, but she can get better.

However, until she gets better, I wouldn't be comfortable being around her or leaving your son with her. I think it might be best to try and distance yourself, for your son...with her record, do you think getting CPS involved would be beneficial at all? Because as of right now, she is unfit to be a mother, if not an outright danger to herself and others. And her parents don't sound like they're creating a healthy environment for anyone.

If I were in your position I would most certainly feel betrayed and frustrated - you've given her time, given her fair justifications, you've been communicating.

In my eyes, both your gf and the other guy are being disrespectful towards you. They're both disregarding your feelings and your boundaries. I mean, he has known about you and your discomfort with his advances, yet he persists, pushing further and further. Your gf may feel afraid of confrontation and hurting his feelings by ""ending their friendship,"" which might contribute to her unsure, back-and-forth behavior. That's just a guess though; I (23F) am very shy and passive, and have been in somewhat similar situations and being too afraid to end things, meaning facing the painful truth, only prolongs the inevitable. Depends on what sort of person she is, I suppose.

Still, she (and the other guy) are being immature. Yes, most ultimatums are unhealthy, but yours isn't a black and white thing. It's the final straw after giving her several chances and extensions of trust (which she is breaking).

I'm not saying that's what happened to you, obviously I have no idea, but it's not a common occurrence to my knowledge. Might be something to consider, if you haven't. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject20,, 2018-09-22 17:36:55 , reddit post ," Right there with you. Tangled with other fucked up things (several mentally illnesses), but the benzos (and Adderall/Vyvanse) over the past 2.5 years ruined me. I had just graduated undergrad, magna cum laude. But I took a couple years off to figure out what I wanted to do; I was so lost.

In that time prescription drugs took over my life. It was a constant stupor and I can't remember much. Like I lost time and I felt my mental faculties diminish, which was devastating. Couldn't think straight, no energy to care about a goddamn thing and I just wanted to be nothing. To not exist.

So the benzos got worse and worse, but I did get into a grad program last fall. Guess what, I was so out of my mind and a lazy shit that I pretty much failed out. It was an embarrassment and waste of money. I had a tuition waiver to be a TA, which was the only way I could afford it. Gone. I failed. Was taking enough benzos to seriously harm myself but nothing ever happened, so it can't be that serious right. I'm taking 8, 12, 14, 16mg of Klonopin at a time but it's not doing too much like it does to people on the internet, so what's the big deal. No one around me noticed. 4-5mg of Xanax? Yeah, no one noticed. Not like I ended up in jail across the state.

Now I'm more depressed than ever. I just don't want to believe that this is really my life.
I am going into an inpatient clinic in a couple weeks but honestly, I don't think my insurance will pay for enough time and I've permanently screwed up my life.
Let's hope that I'm wrong.

Please try. I may feel like a failure, maybe you do too. But we're the only ones who can change that. Please hold that hope with me. "

I'd like to think I'm alright at it, I've been complimented on it before, but I've not been with many men and I'm almost 24. But I try to focus on the whole thing - hands, some fondling, teasing the tip, twirling my tongue, tickling the balls...and I love sloppy.

But it's like once it gets good, nicely sloppy and I get into my rhythm, my jaw starts to hurt. I have no gas reflex either; I enjoy deepthroating and I know he likes when it surprises him. It's really a combo of my jaw getting sore, him lasting too long, and...my current guy that I've been with for 4.5 years has never been into them. Kills me. He's only come once from a bj, from me, 2 years ago and he says he just doesn't care for them.

I love giving them. I'd love to wake him up with that...so sexy. I'm hoping I can somehow help him enjoy receiving oral? I love swallowing his load; it makes me feel accomplished (lol). I don't know what to do though. Any advice?

Oh, and if it's pertinent, he does not masturbate and has a low libido (also kills me). We only have sex 2-3 times a MONTH. Yeah, I know it's bad. Maybe getting him more into oral would help with his sex drive, idk. I love him but I hate this :/ "

Graduated undergrad magna cum laude, then I couldn't be assed to do anything but lay in bed not existing and unable to form a coherent thought.
I'm so ashamed that I let it get this bad, and of how much of a failure and disappointment I am.

Currently looking at a few rehab programs but I have shit insurance, my family has no money, I haven't held down a job for longer than 6 months (see above), and I'm so afraid to just fucking call. Feel like a loser. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject20,, 2018-09-12 22:15:35 , reddit post ," I agree with that; I'm not wholly sure...he's never been very into oral in general, saying he's only ever finished from a bj once (with me, but still).

I just asked him frankly and he said he likes ""doing it"" more than a bj, which I guess makes sense if he doesn't get off from it (also bothers me). He said the reason he doesn't go down on me, verbatim, is because he's ""lazy."" :/

I'm glad I brought it out in the open, maybe I can persuade him. Which I shouldn't have to do in the first place, but yeah. So essentially I think it's because he doesn't enjoy receiving as much as most other guys?

I've brought it up to him only a few times, but...it really bothers me. Not only does it feel damn good, it makes me feel appreciated - like he's willing to do that for me even if he doesn't necessarily like to. Plus it adds some wetness down there, which always helps.

But he doesn't seem to have any interest, at all. It makes me feel self-conscious, like...am I smelly? Am I that gross? Does my vagina look weird or something??
I go down on him, in fact I enjoy it. I like knowing that I'm giving him pleasure; totally turns me on. I feel he's being selfish, inconsiderate and even lazy. Otherwise, I love him to bits.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject20,, 2018-08-17 23:14:13 , reddit post ," I empathize with you and your situation, and I'm very sorry you have to go through this. Almost two years ago, I too underwent a surgical procedure at barely 5 weeks. It was devastating, but I knew I wouldn't have been able to provide for a child as they deserve - I was not well mentally or financially, at all. It hurt but I knew I wouldn't have been able to show that child the love that they deserve. I struggled with immense guilt, shame and self-loathing for a long while. But please realize this: **you are not killing your baby**. You are not doing anything ""wrong."" You are doing what you think is best for you, your family, and your future child(ren). Even though it feels awful, no one is looking down on you except for yourself (and you shouldn't be). It's okay. It really will be okay. You're doing what's best despite the suffering.

As for the procedure itself - I know procedures aren't 100% identical but it's not nearly as scary as it sounds. It takes less than an hour, and physically you should be feeling better in about a week, if even. Yes, the hormones are a hot mess...they can cloud your thinking and emotions so strongly, but as they simmer down I think you'll be able to reflect more clearly. Rest for the body and mind. I did a lot of writing during this time to cope with my intense emotions. That's important too, making sure that you have some emotional support and coping skills.

I know that this is definitely cheesy, but here are a couple thoughts that might comfort you:

1. Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, only transformed. Souls are energy; raw, unified energy. You are not destroying anything. You may not be ready right now, but your baby will find its way back to you. Maybe in another time, in another place, but nothing is lost.

2.  Ultimately, you're doing what you're doing out of love. Love, not hate. You're waiting until you can give a child all the love it needs and deserves rather than unnecessary, imminent hardship. You want to spare pain, and you are. You're sparing yourself, everyone around you, and your future children. And by doing that, you're already a loving mother. You're both just waiting, and there's **nothing** wrong with that.

I sincerely hope that I haven't said anything out of turn or upsetting, and I wish you the best of luck and safe recovery.   "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject20,, 2018-08-14 18:39:27 , reddit post ," I graduated with my B.S. in Zoology in December 2015 and still haven't gotten a job. In early 2016 I got progressively more and more into drugs, slowly but surely. I was out of my damn mind, and only now do I recognize it. I'm ashamed. I don't remember much of the past 2.5 years. I know I've had a couple manic or mixed phases during that time - but otherwise, I'm so depressed that I don't...care about anything, yet I am weighed down by EVERYTHING. I hate myself and my lazy excuses. I hate myself for not helping myself and letting it get this bad.

In the middle of 2016 the man I love broke up with me. That definitely contributed, hard. We got back together at the end of that year but mentally I was long gone. I wasn't me. I hate that. He is still with me, is proud of me and loves me. He is supportive, which I need because I have a poor relationship with my dysfunctional family. But...I am still so empty.
I started grad school last fall (2017) and it did not go well. I used to be a wonderful student; now I was so apathetic and lethargic that I didn't go to most of my classes and instead preferred to stupor myself into stupidity in bed.

And, before I went to grad school, I found out I was pregnant. 7 weeks. I knew I couldn't have been the mother that any child deserves. I did not have the means, in any way, to give a child the love and life they deserve. It was a long, devastating decision and I had no one to talk to about it, not even my own mother. It took a long time to recover, and it hurts my heart still to think of my sweet baby. It hurts deeply. It almost had a heartbeat - I'm tearing up just writing it. Again, more fuel for my downward spiral.

I am still in my graduate program, by a thread. I'm on a academic warning for the first time in my life. I feel embarrassed and horrible that I've let everyone down, not performed to my ability, and have left such a poor impression on my advisor and professors. I am currently applying for a medical leave of absence for at least one semester while I commit to a rehab center. I know I will be successful if I get better; I can be myself again. I'm there somewhere. I hope the department approves my application, though my doctor said she's more than willing to fill out any paperwork or write something so they know it's legit. However, I'm worried that my bad first impression is lasting and that I've screwed up my academic career (I suppose I could re-take a couple classes for a better grade, but ffs I'm almost 24 with nothing going for me and that would take more time and tuition). I'm already $60k+ deep in student loan debt.

My drug problem has gotten a lot better since this past May, but I know I need help or I will relapse eventually. I have an addictive personality, I'm a perfectionist to a fault, neurotic, extremely anxious, emotionally stunted, clinically depressed. I also have bipolar II, and have had a rough struggle with bulimia for the past 6 years. My family is a whole can of mentally unstable/disturbed worms; it runs in my blood.
No one knows just how bad it is/was but myself. I can't bring myself to look people in the eye out of shame. It has to change. I have to change.

I'm sorry I rambled into a wall of text. Feels good to vent a bit.
