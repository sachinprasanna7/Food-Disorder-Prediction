Otherwise she would get mad at me. ""Look all the food you made me cook and you dont finish it"". ""We can\'t waste food, finish it all"". ""You can\'t go out to play unless you finish your food"". When my binges occur, I have this voice in my head that says ""FINISH IT FINISH IT FINISH IT"". I could not keep a peanut butter jar in my house for months.\n\n​\n\nOne time, a glass jar fell on the floor. I ate everything. Even pieces of glass. Yes, I know, this is madness. I hit rock bottom here.\n\n​\n\nI have been working a lot on this lately. I\'m sharing what works for me: \n\n​\n\n* I read Intuitive Eating and the ""Clean Plate"" issue is discussed in the book. You might give this book a try. Another book that helped me a lot: Eating Mindfully\n* I eat at the table. No longer eating in the kitchen, standing, no longer eating in front of the tv. \n* You are not a trash can my friend. You are not the place where the leftovers end. It\'s okay to throw food away or save it for tomorrow. I always had this panic of ""Mom will get mad if I don\'t finish my plate"". Mom doesn\'t live with me anymore, I\'m an adult, I can do whatever I want. I paid the food with my own money, I don\'t owe her anything.\n* You need to learn to identify your hunger cues. STOP and think: Am I full? Does my stomach hurt? Can I stand up and walk without feeling like I have a bag of rocks in my stomach?\n* If you want to eat something, prepare it at the kitchen, save jars, bags, everything in their place, go to the table, sit there, put the phone away, turn off the TV, eat slowly. Chew carefully. Ask yourself: Am I full? Do I feel satiated? Focus on the food and your feelings. Do you want Peanut butter? Ok, have some of it, put it on a cookie or something, put that in a plate, close the jar, wash the spoon, go and sit in the table. Eat. \n* Use your watch/clock. Try to spend AT LEAST 20 minutes eating. Fast eating and swallowing won\'t do you any good. If you spend more time with the food, you will feel satiated and you\'ll be able to stop before being too full.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nI apologize for my english, it\'s not my first language.\n\n​' "

Oh my God, it was awful. Food made me sick. I didn\'t want to eat.

Basically, I\'ve been eating in the wrong way all of my life. This book has taught me to actually focus on the food, tasting it, chewing it, paying attention to it and I\'m feeling so different. I actually started to feel full, I never felt ""full"" before when eating, I could binge for hours and still feel unsatisfied. During the last couple of days, every meal takes me about 30 minutes and I actually feel satiated.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nAnyway, just wanted to share something that has been working for me lately.
