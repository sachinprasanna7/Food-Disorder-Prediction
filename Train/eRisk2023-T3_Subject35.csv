It\'s not worth the time and effort to be with someone who compares you to others. Looks fade, personality doesn\'t. Love and compassion are qualities that will define you as a human being.

I need a lot of time and I don't know the Isle cause they're completely different in his countrie and I know he hates shopping anyways, I asked him to maybe eat something beforehand cause when he is hungry, more likely to snap at people (which everyone can do). I'm at the Isles trying to find something and he loses his patience and snaps at me. I went silent and tried to hurry up. I was all quite and he asks me are you al right? I don't say anything but start crying and he says no you're not. I think he gave me a hug when we came home. He said he was sry and would eat before next time. I didn't say much cause it was already clear. But he has never done it again. And I have learnt that I should/can speak up around him and he won't get mad at me.

Your girlfriend needs help and it is gonna be very hard once you live together and she hasn\'t sought treatment yet, cause eventho you\'ll support her, she needs a professional.

Patience is key. ED is a combination of many unresolved problems, coping mechanisms and trauma respons strategies. When not dealt with emotions can run really high and especially in a relationship. She might need lots of validation, feel insecure, it might affect going out for meals and socialising. Read all you can about it and being there even when there\'s nothing to say, or solve right away. You might experience anger at times and helplessness. If she\'s open for change that\'s good. And there might be fall-backs so what I\'m saying is its not gonna go away just like that...it can take years...keep communicating and don\'t censor your emotions. We learn best from others behaviour and their ability to resolve issues in a healthy way. But we\'re also human, so it\'s ok if you ""fail"" sometimes.  This is important for her to see as well."

The way she inflicts damage on you like that, is reason enough not to have her opinions weigh any matter on your decisions in life. We want to be around people who lift us up, that\'s how love shows their true colour - if someone is only there to bring you down to make themselves feel better they do not have intentions to care for your best interests. They don\'t deserve to be part of it.   I keep my mother at a distance, so that whatever she thinks or does can\'t affect my life and happiness. Sometimes you just have to let go - when they\'re not a parent but a parasite..to put it blunt  You don\'t have to explain anything. If you really feel like you need to say something you can say ""that\'s not up to you"" and ""this is what I want and you\'re not a part of it or get to have a say in it"".

I\'m pretty satisfied so it doesn\'t really bother me.

On top of that, it might seem nice but you never know what people are going through behind closed doors.  I also have theraphy, it keeps me stable and helps me with intrusive thoughts.

It's just like the early stages of every relationship. It takes time to get to know each other and it takes time to build up experiences you've had to then have something special to talk about.   You say they already hate you, why is it that you think that? You say you don't want to get into it, it's difficult to assess someone's situation and help them out if you don't understand the context. But if this is true its  natural to be putting extra pressure on you.   I think you have to high expectations of yourself, you're not going somewhere to perform. You're  meeting other human beings.   Talk to your partner, I think it's essential that he knows how you feel and can help you out with situations you're uncomfortable with or will get anxiety from.  Btw you're not weak. You're precious and your bf obviously wants to be with you and share with his family how much you mean to him. More likely it says that you're pretty awesome and worth being seen."

I think a long distance relationship for you right now will be a bit overwhelming in the long run cause it demands quite a lot of time and effort -energy wise and emotionally. You have kids, and ldr is about communicating A LOT which is time consuming and having plans and schedules to maintain the emotional connection -investment. If you were to move on from your ex you need something easy/uncomplicated and reliable to help keep stability.  But if you really like each other and you're ready to get into a relationship again that's up to you. Ldr is a lot about trust as well...do you have the reserves to do all this?

We can\'t expect people to love us just the way we picture how they should, cause that ultimately says we don\'t love them just the way they love and are and having high expectations like that is impossible to satisfy cause ultimately we like spending time with them cause they\'re awesome and a surplus to our lifes, not just because they love us and validate us- that\'s our own job"

I had a bf at the time who was really good at sitting patiently with me during meals and if I pretended to forget it was dinnertime he just casually initiated it. He also kept reassuring me that he liked my body way much more now -youre beautiful you look amazing in that dress- whatever you know and just listening when I had a hard time without trying to fix it. I hope you can use some of that, of course we are all different and some ed individuals are more defensive than others, just keep trying and being at eas with who you are, automatically makes others mirror you."

Look at it like this, his determination and work effort is an investment for better future possibilities in terms of being more financially able to see you and put some money into that piggy bank of living together eventually.

You can easily misunderstand each other over text, so I recommend video calling when it comes to quality time.  If you feel something is missing/sad/distraught talk about it, don't let it build up.  You can still do things together virtually like, baking, playing games, doing a recipe together, watch a film ect.  Intimacy might feel odd at first but sexting and video, can be really fun and a great way to keep it \xe2\x80\x9calive\xe2\x80\x9d.  Make sure to give space when the other person needs it and not take it personally, calling every day and trying to squeeze in activities can be quite time-consuming so it's good to keep your own hobbies alive.   When you miss each other, talk about future plans cause time goes by faster than you'll know it.  It's an exciting time for you and ldr can actually make you really close, so don't worry and also take it as an opportunity to focus on things you wish to catch up on in your life.

If you feel herself distancing and maybe using the pandemic as an excuse to not met then she probably truly isn't ready for it.

If you keep doing this people will not think you genuinely need help. Your mother might be more inclined to listen, without the big gesture where she doesn't know what to do.

I know a lot people say you can be in a relationship and have friendships with the opposite sex but some people aren't wired that way and as long as you've had a history together of dating you will always be a threat to the current relationship.

Tell her about yourself if she's shy and anything small or daily is exciting for a person you find interesting.

My friend paid for the large number of bills and that while her husband got through school for a high degree which now means his salary is twice as big as hers and can provide for them even better. My partner has more than me and I am just starting school but I try my best to equalize it as much as I can but in the long run it'll be worth it so she's just a great supporter investing in the relationship!:)

Maybe he really will think about it, mentioning it again is more pressure, guys shot down. We women don't think of it as pressure but I once told my bf that I wanted him to talk more about himself we've together for a long time and I was in an unsatisfied mood and after a few days I felt the urge to bring it up again but after a little thought I decided not to cause I could sense his withdrawal was a reaction of the already presented pressure. I let it pass(it was hard!) but it was a turning point and a revelation cause he came around to be okay with being himself again and have a more natural process of our relationship. I don't know if that makes sense to you but I just thought about if I talked to another woman the same way she would not see it as pressure the same way that they do. Hope it's not insensitive to your situation just a perception... "
