As others have pointed out, it's just not saying much at the moment.  I'm no expert in recruiting, but I can share my own experience. I got my first gig about two years ago, I had been coding for a little over 3 months. I came from design so I decided to leverage that and try go strong into creative development (as others have mentioned, find a niche). I built a portfolio to showcase that. I sent a looooot of resumes and was very straight up about my short experience, but a relatively small agency decided to give me a shot and I learned so much with them while honestly being very generously compensated for my lack of experience.  So I think the take aways are: Find a niche Dont oversell yourself, be honest And go for companies that are willing to let you learn with them, this part is really a hit or miss but you'll get it eventually   Welcome to the team, and best of luck in your journey!"

The best way I can think of doing this, there might be others, is to build a crawler which browses the web, and like I said, just reports on bad responses.   This isn't difficult or expensive, matter of fact a lot of people and companies do this sort of things for various reasons. The problem is that by pure statistics, the number of sites you will find is limited.

Also, I don't know your situation but my honest advice is, get your degree in Ireland.
