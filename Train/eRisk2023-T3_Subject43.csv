My insulin is still way out of control on 2,000mg of Metformin. I'm starting to wonder if I actually have Cushing's that's mimicking PCOS? My endocrinologist says I have \xe2\x80\x9cmetabolic syndrome\xe2\x80\x9d as well because I've gone untreated so long. I have long had a buffalo hump and recently it's gotten even larger. I hold all my weight in my lower abdomen like an inner tube, and have lots of stretch marks that come on super easily. I also flush a lot, and have a lot of the symptoms of Cushing's. I see my endocrinologist in a few weeks and am curious about ruling in/out Cushing's. I only had one fasting cortisol which came back at 12.3 ug/dL. Is it possible for one test to be normal and another time not to be?   Here's a photo of my hump: https://imgur.com/a/ja5DA63  (And yes I have acanthosis nigricans on my neck from Insulin issues)."

eRisk2023-T3_Subject43, b' ' , b'2022-10-14 20:26:08' , reddit post ,"there's low carb and then there's keto. keto is when you eat so low carb your body is in ketosis constantly. you can feel quite ill in the beginning and if you're active you may feel sick because your body is using to burning carbs for energy. however low carb is good at preventing blood sugar spikes, it's equally beneficial to go low glycemic or complex carb/low simple carb instead. low carb is okay, total keto can be harmful. i started experiencing life threatening blood sugar drops on keto and haven't been the same since. plus when you stop (as it's not very sustainable) you will likely gain all of your weight back + more than you started with. it can make your hair fall out because of losing too quickly (as can any fast weight loss). gallbladder attack risk and liver issue risk increases with losing weight too fast but especially with keto due to high fat content that it usually has. essentially keto works by calories in calories out, it's not magic except for its effect on blood sugar and insulin is why it's recommended for pcos. without pcos, it's always calories in calories out. no diet is more effective than that and all of them work because of cico."

Breakfast: Chick-fil-a Egg White Grill (300 cals)   Lunch: Greek salad with Italian dressing (675 cals with dressing about 800) and 16 oz. Blueberry Banana smoothie (~300 cals)   Dinner: Varies but usually Chipotle Chicken Burrito Bowl with light white rice, light sour cream, side of guacamole (to make sure cals are accurate), light cheese (895 cals).   Late night: Salami Panino (150 cals for 2 pieces), Apple slices or fruit (60-120 cals), sometimes Sabra Hummus snackers (370 cals), Pickle bites (15 cals).   Depending on the day I'll have a sweet for about 200-300 cals. I don't do everything on that list every day but I rotate through them depending on cravings and calorie allotment. I burn off about 200-500 calories per day with exercise. Right now averaging about 38% fat, 44% carbs, 28% protein. I'm shooting to lower the carbs and fat and up the protein and fiber.

One of the things to remember though is once your anxiety is calm enough, you have to force it more. Go further. Go longer. And I think that's where a lot of people stagnate. Or they never figure out what the underlying panic is from. Like what are you scared of? Cause it's not outside. There's a scenario that plays in your head when you feel that fear. Work through it in a safe place, trigger it like you're experiencing it in a safe environment and learn to sit with it comfortably. Mine was fear of passing out or a health emergency. So I kept doing stuff while I felt those symptoms like dizziness and eventually I learned that no matter what I am in control of the situation. I may feel dizzy but I'm not going to die or get sick. And remember: you can always go back. You are never trapped. You are capable and you can trust your body to look out for you. These are the ideas that got me through the panic. Sometimes I would pull over and take a second to calm myself, and that's okay. The main thing is you're still doing the exposure."

I would sip the cold water and fidget with the cap to distract myself. I viewed my water bottle as my \xe2\x80\x9csafe place\xe2\x80\x9d since I couldn't stay inside, it was like a \xe2\x80\x9csafe person\xe2\x80\x9d but an object instead so I didn't need to rely on anyone else. Eventually I was able to get rid of the water bottle but it helped a lot. I had to really learn breathing exercises (they had never helped in the past until I did it right), sometimes I'll flap my hands to let the anxiety out or go for a walk to get some of the stagnant anxiety out. Cold water sips also help with nausea so it's a good method."

I would say it's both. While some exposures required me to just rip the bandaid off, I also did smaller exposures in the beginning until I felt more confident in myself. For example, I couldn't be home alone or shower alone in the beginning my agoraphobia was so severe. So I started by showering alone repeatedly to get used to that. Eventually I felt strong enough to drive a massive trigger road by myself.   Absolutely set backs and I still have it sometimes where my brain fights me. It tells me to \xe2\x80\x9cstay in\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cwe can't do that\xe2\x80\x9d. I just tell myself I am not going to allow myself to be back in the miserable place I started. I let myself have my anxiety but refuse to let it stop me now. I will just tell someone \xe2\x80\x9cI am sorry if I'm being weird, I'm having a panic attack\xe2\x80\x9d instead of hiding it.   For me, panic attacks themselves. I've had panic attacks since I was around 5-6 years old. But the fear kept me in my agoraphobia. I had to restructure myself to embrace the panic attack (which is very very difficult) and to learn to sit with discomfort rather than run. I would reassure myself panic attacks cannot kill you or cause serious damage and they ALWAYS have to end at some point. It cannot last forever, your body just can't sustain that.   I do still have symptoms but I would still consider myself recovered. I've recovered in the past and symptoms have totally disappeared for years so I know it's possible but I think I'm still early on and I need to earn my secure attachment to the outer world for a bit longer. After 2-4 years, I felt totally agoraphobia free in the past. I still get pangs of anxiety, tight throat, sweaty hands when driving. Or if I have plans that I feel trapped in, I remind myself I am never trapped and it helps. I feel anxiety about plans still but I refuse to let it stop me. Instead I coach myself through the panic and embrace it, let myself feel it."

I am addicted to the chaos I was raised in. Healthy relationships make me uncomfortable and feel dull. Because there's no drama. It's peaceful and content. I never learned healthy intimacy/love and finally experiencing it is incredibly uncomfortable and feels wrong. It makes the inner critical voice scream extremely loud and all my trauma responses start flooding me saying it's wrong. Because I'm so used to the dysfunction.

eRisk2023-T3_Subject43, b' ' , b'2022-09-12 06:13:24' , reddit post ,"Those are not what friends are meant to be. When you're damaged as much as we are with C-PTSD we tend to repeat cycles - we go after emotionally unavailable/abusive people (codependency) or we put people off because we haven't dealt with our trauma. We find it safer to seclude ourselves than to open up to true intimacy because it makes us uncomfortable. We never received or knew true tender emotional love/care and some never felt parental love at all. We were neglected and so we accept this pattern of neglect, don't stand up to it, and in the end attract more of it because we have not dealt with our underlying trauma. Some of the time, I don't know if this is the case with OP, I wondered why no one ever reached out to me and I was mad and depressed because I had no socialization. I didn't understand why I never could form deep friendships. Then I realized it was because I didn't know how to form bonds and intimacy at all that wasn't toxic/avoidant. I would run away, ignore texts, not open up, seclude myself until people just stopped trying to invite me because - I never showed up. Relationships do go both ways and require emotional vulnerability on both ends. If you view yourself as flawed and that no one will like you if you are the real you, you will always keep people at arms length out of fear. I'd say OP is suffering from avoidant attachment and freeze trauma response. OP needs to focus on shifting their world view from \xe2\x80\x9cpeople will abandon me, I can't get close, no one likes me\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cI am worth loving and healthy relationships, I can set boundaries, and people will like me for who I actually am rather than putting on a show\xe2\x80\x9d. It's not that we aren't capable, we never learned how to connect emotionally and were abused when we tried. We are damaged and our brains have learned it's safer not to try than to potentially be abused or abandoned again. I HIGHLY recommend the book C-PTSD: From Surviving to Thriving as this covers overcoming this trauma much more in depth and better than I have here."

We would have a long conversation about boundaries and our respective relationships with all of each other.

I would forgive the former if you approached me reasonably and explained what happened. I may even forgive the second to some degree but I can never fully trust you again. We would be fairweather friends and you should never expect me to care about you on a deeper level again. It does depend and I think most Geminis are reasonable and will hear you out.

We need to grieve the loss of this childhood right for ourselves and be compassionate during it. Letting yourself feel your feelings - anger, sadness, denial is important to helping heal the void.

But if you treat some of that you may find it far easier to manage your appetite. At least for me I was the same where I could literally eat 1,800+ calories in one sitting and still be hungry. There's various ways to sort it out including medications but a low glycemic lifestyle or low carb (not necessarily total keto) will lower insulin spikes and keep you satiated longer. At first it's gonna suck but if you give it some time it will start to help with the appetite. Aim for high protein and fiber as they help you feel full longer. You could also do low calorie high volume eating. Where you have a LOT of lower calorie foods so you feel full but without adding a ton of calories."

Still waiting to get a new A1C and insulin checked (I go next month) but 2 months of treatment fasting glucose is 80.  Treatment is 500mg Metformin twice a day.

eRisk2023-T3_Subject43, b' ' , b'2022-07-23 07:46:43' , reddit post ,"Hi if you think this may your issue I highly recommend seeing a reproductive endocrinologist as they as the most knowledgeable on treatment of PCOS. Gynecologists typically will put you on birth control and blow you off. I'm in the medical field with experience as a lab tech so here's the recommendation I would do: transvaginal ultrasound. Bloodwork including: testosterone (free and total), estrogen, progesterone, DHEAs, OGTT (with insulin levels tested fasting and post-prandial), prolactin, cortisol, A1C, LH, FSH, TSH/Thyroid profile, AMH, and SHBG. That gives you a comprehensive hormonal baseline to go from and decide if things are out of whack. The ultrasound may reveal cysts but they aren't totally necessary as long as you have 2/3 criteria: symptoms, cysts on imaging, or off bloodwork. The treatment for mine that I'm on is Metformin 1,000mg, Ozempic 0.5mg (titrating up to 1mg slowly), and Lo Loestrin Fe birth control. Birth control helps add estrogen and progesterone to your system while the others balance insulin and the Metformin can lower testosterone/androgens. Spironolactone is another common PCOS medication as it lowers testosterone and can help with hirsutism and acne. Another option if you struggle with PCOS-like symptoms but can't get these medications is Ovasitol as this mimics the benefits of Metformin. Since these medications, I have had two natural periods, lost weight, and feel so much better."

I never had much hair growth or acne but struggled massively with weight and period pain so everyone is different as well. Bloodwork is a great tool and as a lab technician I can say this is a good comprehensive PCOS work up for bloodwork: Fasting insulin, fasting glucose, OGTT, oral insulin tolerance done at the same time as OGTT, A1C, Testosterone (free and total), Estradiol, FSH, LSH, SHBG, AMH, DHEA, Prolactin, Cortisol, and Progesterone. You'll want to couple this with a new transvaginal ultrasound in a few months especially if you miss your periods as cysts can form rather quickly. For example, I had none 6 months before and then 45 in my right ovary and 38 in my left 6 months later. Highly recommend an endocrinologist or reproductive endocrinologist if you have access to one. They can order these tests, monitor, and treat effectively in a way I find gynecologists don't."

I originally was only at 28 but it quickly got worse and became 43 over a few weeks from how severe mine was. I'd say you're likely insulin resistant and the best thing to do is see an endocrinologist or a reproductive endocrinologist if you can and get a fasting oral glucose tolerance test and a fasting oral insulin tolerance test.

You don't need to overhaul everything at once and if you do, you'll probably feel burnt out really fast. Try eating healthy for just one meal a day at first then upping to 2 or something like that. Try cutting out just soda at first and see how it goes, you may lose weight from that alone.

That way becoming a healthier weight/treating your body kindly will come easier as the mind will be healthier too. Second, a reproductive endocrinologist would be best. They'll likely start you on Metformin which works wonders for a lot of women when trying to conceive with PCOS. They may also induce a bleed with a medication called Provera to shed out old lining as not having a period in a long time can cause uterine cancer. If Metformin doesn't work, they may try Clomid to conceive. But definitely a reproductive endocrinologist is the best of the best for this as they focus on hormonal issues preventing fertility."
eRisk2023-T3_Subject43, b' ' , b'2022-06-19 21:15:37' , reddit post ,I would highly recommend going to a endocrinologist to treat your PCOS in addition to the Inositol (which is great but not quite as strong as medication). You likely have severe insulin resistance on top of the pre-diabetes that needs addressing and addressing that will likely help your appetite which will help you lose weight without feeling restricted. That PCOS is probably causing a lot of the binging/restriction issue. You should also try to find an eating disorder counselor as it sounds like you're suffering with disordered eating which is very common in PCOS. Orthorexia specifically. I have PCOS myself and I used to ALWAYS feel hungry no matter what because of IR and I could eat for like 3-4 people. I suffered the same as you did. No shocker I put on 100+ lbs in a short period of time. Treating my underlying medical issue really freed me of the disordered eating as I feel my mind is clearer and know I can lose weight without my body fighting me constantly.

I do think you feel as if your childhood was robbed from you, perhaps you had to grow up fast and did not get to experience child-like wonder and fun. I get the feeling your household was tense and people did not talk about the hard emotions in life like anger and depression. These things were hushed and covered up - this comes out in the dream in the form of no talking but the boy understanding you. This is a subconscious desire from childhood - to be understood on a mental level by (probably) a father figure in your life. You still feel on some level you have not grown out of your childhood because you're having a hard time coming to terms with how you grew up, you feel it's unfair and that there was \xe2\x80\x9cno end in sight\xe2\x80\x9d to the suffocation you felt growing up. Even in this dream, you are being responsible for an empty red wagon which does not benefit you in any way in the dream. It seems you had more responsibility than should be expected of a child growing up. You feel you were punished for being a kid and feel you cannot get in touch with that sad, lonely inner child that still lives inside you. As with all dream interpretation, if this does not resonate with you, this is not the correct interpretation.

Jung views the dream itself as a drama/play so I'm not surprised your dream used this as an outlet. My interpretation or suggestion would be that you have a fear of failure. You feel it's hard to relate to other people right now and you may not understand societal norms or how others expect you to \xe2\x80\x9cact\xe2\x80\x9d. Perhaps a parent or loved one does not approve of your career choice? Or perhaps you feel you are losing touch with things you used to like doing? Since acting was something you used to enjoy and now you're \xe2\x80\x9cfailing\xe2\x80\x9d at it, it would suggest you feel out of sorts with your old interests and hobbies. Back to the point of not being in touch with your emotions/societal norms, \xe2\x80\x9ccramming\xe2\x80\x9d could symbolize the external pressure from the world you may be feeling about your future choices/life choices/career choice, and you feel you can fake it or lie about how you're feeling but it's not something you're interested in doing. To me, the acting aspect of this dream would symbolize the unconscious or emotional side of your life, you may feel you are failing there. As with all dream interpretations, this must resonate with you to be the real interpretation and if it does not, then you'll likely have this dream repeat until you recognize the underlying symbolic meaning or solve the issue the dream is trying to address.

Tarot changes with every draw and can answer a broader spectrum of answers than astrology. There is a lot more options with tarot where as the planets are stable. Yes astrology can predict some illnesses and yes it may tell you why you felt depressed last Tuesday but can it tell you if you'll win the lottery? I guess transits can be used this way but it seems harder to use than tarot for trivial pursuits. It may tell you you're a lucky person but it's not the same at predicting events with as much detail as tarot. Both are useful but I think they have their own uses in different scenarios. For example, if I wanted to know if I'd win a sweepstakes giveaway I'm more likely to use tarot, if I want to know how I love in a relationship I'm more likely to use astrology. Both are valid forms of divination and their own hobby in their own, but I think you need to be skilled at knowing how and when to apply them. Astrology would be divination of the self, I use tarot for divination of events. Sometimes I combine the two - tarot draw and then transit natal chart for the same day."

Currently have Covid but this issue pre-dates my current infection although having Covid and having to blow my nose has irritated them more. They feel dry and tight and every few days a scab is coming off from them and sometimes it's bleeding. It just keeps reforming instead of healing up though. It's like a skin colored/yellowish scab. It kind of burns and feels like a pulling sensation to swipe my hand up my nostrils like if I was wiping my nose. Pain isn't unbearable just uncomfortable. Kind of throbs and tingles at times? There doesn't seem to be any pus and they don't seem to have spread although it's hard to see because they're so deep in my nose. At first I thought maybe this was just from the cold weather but it hasn't seemed to heal despite leaving it alone as much as possible. I haven't really had any trauma to the nose other than blowing it from a runny nose and getting Covid tests done. Should I bother going to the doctor? It's hard to get appointments right now and I don't really wanna go if it's not serious. Concerned about a Staph infection or something although I would think that would've spread by now, no?

During invocation with President Buer, I asked for some answers to the existential dread I had been feeling. The following is what I learned:   The astral realm exists with the physical plane in a sort of Venn Diagram manner. The overlap is where we are able to access higher planes of consciousness. It's not so much about the lines on the diagram but rather the empty space that we should focus on. There are many astral planes that are layered on top of one another like a layered shingle of a roof top. Negative space is that which can't be touched or perceived, we can never truly understand it. Negative space is the human mind. The air elemental plays a significant role in moving between the planes of existence. You can somehow use the circle of life to access personal transmutation and the air elemental is also significant in this process. Death and rebirth are heavily related to the existential planes.

I practice forms of occultism regularly and I feel pretty in tune with the other planes of existence.   About 4 months ago, July 2021, I took a nap in my bedroom after work. This was pretty typical for me. Nothing felt off that day, although I can't remember the exact day. When I woke up from my nap, for a brief few seconds I saw a man standing over me, looking at me. I will try to describe him below.   He was about 5'8\xe2\x80\x9d or 5'9\xe2\x80\x9d, white male with reddish-brown curly hair put up into a bun like thing with a bandana wrapped around where his hairline was. He did not have freckles. I believe his eyebrows were brown in color, a bit mismatched from his hair color. He was wearing what I think was a green tank top and khaki work-type pants which were baggy on his thin to medium frame. He was a bit lanky in build but not a total toothpick. He was wearing a large black backpack on his back and possibly a walking cane? He definitely gave me the impression he was a hitchhiker/nomad of some type. I only saw him for a fraction of a second before he disappeared but I was not having a dream during that nap. Nothing was said, he just stood there for a second before disappearing. I believe myself to be awake when this occurred. I don't experience sleep paralysis and I was not during this event.   A few days later, I had a nightmare of a Latino man standing in the corner of my room. This time I was fully asleep unlike the previous in which I was awake. This man looked very evil, he had short brown hair, roughly 6'0\xe2\x80\x9d-6'2\xe2\x80\x9d, can't remember what he was wearing as it was focused on his face. He stared at me from around the corner of my dresser. Somehow he was within the dresser yet behind it. He had very intense dark black hair and eyebrows with evil looking tense brown eyes. His hair was short, almost like an overgrown buzz cut. He furrowed his brow and just stared at me until I woke up into a panic attack.   Can someone please explain what the hell this was about? Can anyone find information on any missing persons/dead persons who match these descriptions? I'm still a bit freaked out because if I try I can still \xe2\x80\x9csee\xe2\x80\x9d both of them in my head. They were both very vivid experiences. Any theories or ideas are welcomed and appreciated."

This can come in the form of verbal reassurance or physical actions taken. This may seem temporarily gratifying to the individual who is experiencing anxiety or negative emotions. In the long run, however, it perpetuates feelings of not being able to trust your own judgment and the need for reassurance may become more and more intense or frequent. There are many different types of reassurance loops, but the most common with Health Anxiety are asking other people if they experience similar symptoms, asking for others to calm them down during periods of high distress, and body checking.

I kinda relax relieved it didn't drill into her. But then she says something to the guy and so he drills harder, causing some scratches and pain. Still not enough to seriously injure her. At this point I'm trying to pull her away from the dude. Before I can, he presses the drill one last time and it drills straight through her abdomen and out her back.

I didn't sleep all that well but basically I was living with some roommates I didn't recognize as someone in real life in this dream. Takes place in a childhood home I don't live in anymore for relevancy. We were having a casual conversation outside while we were watching I think some little kid on Valentine's Day in the dream? Well there was roses I was holding that my grandpa had given me at some point during the dream while we were talking. Anyway this person was a male (medium build, brown semi-bowl cut hair, shorter than me by a little, had this smug looking face) and he just kept criticizing everything I said or did. Like I went to put the flowers in the compost area cause they were wilting along with some trimmed off hair I guess. I don't remember exactly what this guy said but it was rude and I remember saying something like, \xe2\x80\x9cOh yea, that's a fair point but I leave the hair for the birds to nest with!\xe2\x80\x9d It seemed like even though he was criticizing me at first I was trying to maintain a peaceful encounter for the sake of living together. But eventually I got sick of his constant criticism and so I went off of him and basically said, \xe2\x80\x9cLook I know it's hard for you to give a shit about anyone other than yourself but I'm really tired of you constantly shitting on everything I do or say. It doesn't cost you anything to take 4 minutes out of your day to be nice to me. I understand you probably had a really privileged cozy upbringing where you didn't have to, but it's just the decent thing to do to be kind to others\xe2\x80\x9d was the gist of my little rant to him. He looked stunned like no one had ever said that shit to him and I stormed off irritated and annoyed throwing the rest of my flowers I had on the ground. Pretty sure that's when I woke up. For even more context, I am not a shy person in waking life. I can be confrontational when need be and I don't mind standing up for myself or others so it seems odd to me to have a dream about this?"

My grandmother died in 2013 from aggressive breast cancer that spread through her whole body and I did witness her basically dying. I was young when this happened but old enough to remember it.  Anyways, let's cut to the dream world. It was taking place in the house she died in. I was sitting on our living room floor with my grandfather (still alive irl) and watching television. I was facing a dark hallway that's actually there in the real house. I suddenly see someone come out of the bathroom and cross over to their bedroom. I say \xe2\x80\x9cNana?\xe2\x80\x9d and she turns and looks at me. (During this dream I am aware that she should not be alive still). She's in a night gown, maybe a pink one, and looks like herself but gaunt and pale. I don't remember exact details here but she's going on about how \xe2\x80\x9cshe's going to die soon anyway\xe2\x80\x9d but that they were wrong when they thought she was dead and that she had a little more time left. So she starts walking into the living room in front of me and trips and falls onto the rug on the floor. I yell, \xe2\x80\x9cNana!\xe2\x80\x9d and go to help her up. I scoop her up in my arms like a baby and am holding her near my face sort of. Up close she looks way aged beyond her years, leathery, and extremely gaunt and emaciated. She seems annoyed with still being alive. But I tell her \xe2\x80\x9cI love you\xe2\x80\x9d and start crying. She says \xe2\x80\x9cI love you, too\xe2\x80\x9d and I just continue to cry while holding her. Then out of nowhere there's suddenly a fireplace at the foot of where we're sitting and I start smelling something weird. It takes me a few minutes to realize we're both on fire but mostly me. My grandma got put out pretty quickly. I am rolling around panicking, on fire, and I embarrassingly had to strip off my pants in front of everyone in this dream. Then I think I got it out but I woke up right about then choking and coughing in real life. Help?"

Like I haven't had one since then even come close to how horrific and traumatic that panic attack was. Until 2 days ago. I had the exact adrenaline rush, no trigger type panic attack while out driving. Previously, it would've kept me inside for who knows how long or I wouldn't have been able to move on. In 2020, after that panic attack I avoided the area it happened in for 6+ months and could barely go 5 minutes to the gas station. But nope! I decided it was just a panic attack, did breathing exercises, talked to someone to distract me, pulled over, waited out the symptoms, and kept going. I desperately wanted to drive home (since I was already driving when it hit). But I decided my anxiety WOULD NOT stop me that day. So I went down my January 2020 panic trigger road right after my recent panic attack. I went and visited my family and stayed for 4 hours. And I was totally FINE.

Well I was raised by an anti-vaxxer and was also falling for the media scaring the daylights out of me reporting on all kinds of crazy and terrifying rare side effects. But against my anxiety, I spontaneously booked my appointment. As time drew closer, I became more and more anxious, CONVINCED I would be the special 0.1% with crazy side effects. Well, I get the shot and did the 15 minute waiting period. Nothing. Maybe a small twinge of pain from getting a shot but nothing happened. I continued being anxious for the rest of the night. Woke up still kicking and totally fine. Still nothing. I had a slight sore arm for a few hours and the mildest leg aches of any illness I've ever had. Seriously a regular cold is FAR worse than the shot. Anyways what I'm saying is, we get so caught up in our anxiety but we neglect that we aren't as special as we think. We are more likely to be the 99.9% that is fine than the 0.1% or 0.0005% that isn't. I am a week out from my first dose and absolutely NOTHING horrible has happened to me like I assumed would.

For reference, I *believe* I had COVID-19 pretty early on in the pandemic but since there was no testing available, I cannot say for certain. I was a long hauler and had pretty devastating long term effects including pulmonary and cardiac symptoms.   Preparation Taken: I hydrated extra the night before the vaccine and the day of. Electrolyte drinks and water were consumed, including a drink containing 90mg of Vitamin C. I avoided Tylenol and other pain medication the day of the vaccine. I considered taking Magnesium to avoid muscle pain but did not end up doing so. I have heard Magnesium has good success in preventing arm pain post-injection. I ate a meal a few hours before inoculation.   Day 0, 6:30PM: I got Pfizer. Was administered around 6:30PM on 6/4/21. Before the shot I was totally freaking myself out as I'm a diagnosed Hypochondriac. So I was very hyper aware of everything happening. Upon injection, I heard/felt a splashing or whooshing sound as the vaccine entered my arm and subsequently my muscle. The actual needle did not hurt much, much less painful than Tetanus or Meningitis vaccines I've had in the past. Immediately after injection I felt slightly disoriented and dizzy but I was panicking pre-vaccine so I think that may just be my anxiety. A twinge of sore arm was felt immediately so I rotated my muscle around and the pain subsided. On the car ride home, I felt a twinge of a headache start, no worse than my typical ice pick headaches I normally get. It passed within less than 5 minutes.   Day 0, 7:30 PM: Slight soreness of arm, mild muscle twitching in area (I also have Benign Fasciculation Syndrome so twitches are a common and daily occurrence for me), no other notable symptoms, anxiety has passed.   Day 0, 8:30-10:00PM: Fatigue is definitely setting in, still only mild soreness in arm, mild aches in legs. I don't feel it's enough to even take medication for yet. I feel a bit out of it like when you first wake up in the morning, really want to take a nap but am able to function with a little extra effort. I also worked a morning shift today so I was already tired after work before I received the vaccine.   Day0/1, 01:00-02:00AM (7-8 hours post-vaccine): Took a nap for a few hours, woke up not tired/fatigued anymore. I feel mostly back to normal. Still no fever. Arm soreness is more intense now, pain of mild to medium intensity if I lift arm past shoulder height or if I touch the muscle injection site. No other symptoms than mild headache for a few minutes and maybe a hint of aching pain in my legs. Still not bad enough to even take medicine for. Going to go to bed for the night soon to rest as much as possible.   Day 1, 1:00PM (18 hours post-vaccine): Still totally unremarkable as far as other symptoms than a sore arm. Woke up with a slightly more stiff and sore arm today, massaged the muscle there, feels much better already. May take a Tylenol for the sore arm later in the day but it's nothing I can't handle. Feels like a big bruise or as if I've been punched and it's sore. Slept last night without issue.   Day 1, 6:00-7:00PM (24 hours post-vaccine): Arm was extremely sore and stiff earlier, since moving it around and using it more the pain is subsiding to very light soreness when I lift it up. Still no fever or other symptoms. Feeling a little fatigued but less so than yesterday. Still have not had to take any medication for pain. Studied for classes and went to the grocery store without any issue.   Day 1/2, 03:00AM (Roughly 34 hours post-vaccine): Arm pain has almost entirely subsided except for tenderness if the injection site is pushed on. Still no other symptoms besides very light leg aching. Never developed a fever, intense headache, or other symptoms.   Day 2, 11:30AM (41 hours post-vaccine): Woke up today with my sore arm almost absolutely gone. The soreness is very slight in the back of my arm now towards where the armpit and tricep join. It almost feels like a pimple that's sore now. The injection site is very mildly tender but has decreased a lot. Over the whole ordeal the only other symptom that *may* be related to the vaccine is generalized itching but I do have eczema and other skin conditions so I cannot confirm that the vaccine has directly caused this extra itching since I have not been keeping up with my daily moisture regimen for my eczema. I think I will update at 48 hours and leave it there unless I experience any late-onset symptoms. In which case I will edit to add them.   Day 2, 6:00PM (48 hours post-vaccine): Felt mild fatigue after working a full shift, arm is basically totally painless again. Going to take a nap. Still never developed any crazy or weird symptoms. Body aches mostly subsided, maybe very mild and background leg aches but again, I worked all day with them without medication so it's not bad at all.   Day 2, 12:00AM (65 hours post-vaccine): Arm pain totally gone, no other symptoms after waking up from nap. Feeling energetic and back to normal. I was concerned I would develop delayed symptoms but it never happened.    TL;DR: Got my Pfizer shot even though I was freaking the heck out, developed a sore arm and a little fatigue but otherwise was totally fine. You should get your shot, it might not even be bad."

I feel like I wanted to go for a dog that's been there a while, that no one wanted, perhaps special needs. So I get taken into a room with this dog. He's laying on a dog bed, with his head facing away from me. I'm told his name is Gummy. He is a Dalmatian, Golden Retriever mix so he's spotted like a Dalmatian but with the fluffiness of a Golden Retriever. He's quite large as well, probably coming to my waist when I am standing. As I approach him, he turns his head and finally looks at me. I'm shocked for a second at what I see. His jaw is deformed, a little off center with the lower jaw being too short for the top snout so his tongue is out and he has scarring as if he's had corrective surgery. His lips are taut and show off his gums, hence the name Gummy. He looks like he's always smiling or baring teeth. For a few seconds I'm taken off guard and say \xe2\x80\x9cOh God\xe2\x80\x9d as I wasn't expecting his appearance then he starts wagging his tail at me and I pet him. We're having a good interaction when I wake up. Ideas?"

My neighborhood kinda has a hill you have to go up to exit and I dreamed there was a car in front of me that looked similar to like a Ford Explorer, it was white. We were both turning right, the white car in front of me. It went around the right turn too fast and kinda teetered on its wheels and slowly flipped on its side. Me being behind it I kinda laughed and went around it because it didn't seem that serious. As I went around it, I watched in my rear view mirror and side mirrors as it continued to flip and flip. It went over a curb embankment and started flipping and rolling violently down a steep hill catching air and becoming more dangerous as it fell. This hill doesn't exist in my neighborhood in real waking life. There's a slight dip there but nothing that could actually do this. As I saw it in my rear view I said \xe2\x80\x9cOh shit\xe2\x80\x9d and asked someone in the car with me (I can't remember who) to call 911. Then I woke up. Any ideas?"
eRisk2023-T3_Subject43, b'Covid Vaccine Dream?' , b'2021-05-10 10:03:46' , reddit post ,So I haven't gotten vaccinated yet because I have hypochondria and autoimmune disease so I've been real worried about potential side effects. But I had a dream I was getting the vaccine and basically it was just a whole hours long thing of me trying to find a place to get the shots and then having panic attacks repeatedly once I did. Do you think this is just a reflection of my subconscious concerns about the shot or something deeper?

I haven't lived there in years and I've been in my new house for 10+ years, so, why does my subconscious latch so hard onto his home? What does the setting represent in dream? Mostly looking for Jungian interpretation, not so much literal."

Less judged or something I guess. But anyways I've been doing exposure therapy for over a year pretty much every day now. I decided to make plans with a friend and even though I don't have to go out to see this friend I'm still very anxious about it and my anxiety is making me want to cancel. I already missed out last week because of this and I don't want to back down. I'm worried I guess of having to act normal while having a panic attack or getting overwhelmed and dissociating. Help?
eRisk2023-T3_Subject43, b'Sexual Abuse Nightmare' , b'2021-02-22 20:21:22' , reddit post ,"TW: child sex abuse  . . . . . .  So this dream I am watching a living room. I am there with some random guy I don't know and also a woman. They're both around in their 30s. They seem rather trashy, smoking inside with their child, and their appearance as well. I'm watching from third person I'm not actually present in the room but I'm seeing everything happening. There's a little girl in a hot pink onesie. She seems to be about 3-5 years old. She is sitting in front of the TV watching something. The man is sitting on the floor behind her. The woman is across the room smoking on a different couch. As I am watching the man and little girl, he comes up behind her, and grabs her from behind. He places her between his legs and starts molesting her. It got pretty graphic at times, like using his fingers to do awful things. The little girl was very distressed and upset and trying to get away from the man. I am getting furious but since I am not present I cannot do anything to stop this. As I continue to watch this child being molested, it takes every bit of rage in me and I start spitting blood at the couch where the mother is repeatedly. It felt like I was trying to show my disgust for the mother not taking any action to stop the pedophile father. I kept having to use all of my energy to spit blood all over this tan couch. Any ideas what the heck this means? It was really disturbing to see child sex abuse right in front of me."

Last night I had a dream that I was at the doctor's and they took some blood testing from me (This does happen frequently in waking life to me, I'm also pursuing a career in phlebotomy too). When I got the results then it became apparent it was a hormone panel for me. The results were I had low estrogen and high testosterone. I remember asking the doctor about taking medication to fix it. I am assigned female in real life. Any ideas of significance?"

Well I finally had one. A nightmare. I was in my bathroom at my grandpa's when I used to live with him. And I was using a hair dryer to do my hair. Well when I unplugged it the outlet sparked and started a mini electrical fire. It wasn't so bad and I used a wet cloth to pat it out. I left the room and came back and it was on fire again. Nothing huge, it was pretty contained to the outlet. Basically I spent this whole dream trying to put out this tiny electrical fire and I went to get my grandpa but he just kept telling me it was fine and not to worry. Ideas? It could mean nothing bc I was watching a documentary about arson before bed and also my actual hair dryer in waking life is smelling burnt and acting weird."
