Within that range, the most you'll ever spend on a rocket is probably $350, and most of that money would be spent on the motor case and avionics systems, which are reusable and can easily be moved between different rockets."

I haven't been able to get a result from FinSim, so I'm probably doing something wrong. I might just model the fins based on Additive Aerospace's design, since they've been proven to work up to Mach 2."

It should help distribute it a little more evenly.

eRisk2023-T3_Subject3, b'Would it be better to just use a small parachute (or just find a way to ditch it entirely)?' , b'2022-07-09 10:24:23' , reddit post ,"I attempted my first dual deployment flight (drogueless) and the parachute didn't deploy, but the descent rate was only 11 m/s - definitely higher than ideal, but lower than I expected. Some parts of the structure were damaged, but I think it may have been avoidable with stronger materials (PC/ABS instead of PLA and thin PETG fins) or a tiny parachute to slow it down a bit more. There would be some benefits to reducing the size of the parachute, so is it worth a shot?  The rocket's structure is 100% 3D printed, its dry mass was approximately 285g, and the cross-sectional area was approximately 0.02986m^2. This means the drag coefficient was around 1.63."
