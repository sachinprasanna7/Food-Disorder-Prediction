I just bought a bunch of travel bottles from Sephora to try (blind buys are sometimes foolish, I know, but I also know what notes and combinations I tend to like). I'm hoping I can glean some insight from you all. I love white floral, woodsy/spicy, rich vanilla, and pear. I also like unique/unisex fragrances. Also interested to know if My Way is worth the hype?   Perfumes I love: Dior Hypnotic Poison,  Chloe Nomade,  Mugler Angel/Aura,  YSL Libre Intense,  Givenchy Hot Couture,  Nest Sunkissed Hibiscus,  Replica Whispers in the Library.   I was very disappointed in: V and R Flowerbomb Ruby Orchid,  Valentino Born in Roma,  Miss Dior EDP."

eRisk2023-T3_Subject30, b' ' , b'2020-11-18 18:31:10' , reddit post ,"It\'s a hard narrative to write, I think. The lived experiences of mixed-race people are often subjugated, separated, outcasted and unrelatable.  Try not to focus SO much on their race; it\'s often not the colour of the skin overtly that causes mixed-race people to be rejected. Negative connotations of mixed-ness, being a ""mutt"" and dirty are usually why people reject mixed people.  Your character may find solace in family and the not-closed-minded community.  The idea of ""otherness"" is definitely going to be a big feature of your narrative, I anticipate. An easy way to think of it is as being bullied for having bad teeth or bad skin. These are things that you can\'t control, through no fault of your own. What makes being mixed-race more distinctly painful from these other kinds of discrimination is that it is so fundamental to your identity.  I am white-passing but I identify as both black and white. People have said things like ""you don\'t look black"", ""you don\'t act black"", ""you\'re white and you know it"". I have never felt ""accepted"" by either group and actually hung out with other mixed-raced kids mostly.  For resources, check out things like ""Mixed Remixed"", search ""multiracial resources"" and ""biracial resources"". Also, do some research about mixed-race celebrities; there\'s more than you might think! I\'d be happy to offer any anecdotal insight, too."

I understand that it's main use is for fibromyalgia, but I'm pretty averse to going on antidepressants just because my family hasn't had positive experiences with them and I don't feel depressed or anxious at all.

Two months ago, I woke up with an achy body and headache. The joints in my knees, wrists, elbows and ankles feel tingly and burny deep in the joint, though there is no visible swelling, redness or heat. They are tender to the touch, though I'm not fatigued. I've had knee surgery, sports injuries, and a sore body from the gym, but I've never felt anything quite like this.   My headache starts as a dull ache and escalates to intense stabbing pains. I have been tested for lupus, RA, cancer, infection COVID19 (all negative,) had a non-contrast CT scan of my head (negative), and have been taking naproxen as a result, though I still am getting breakthrough pain. It has never helped the headache but the joint pain has been reduced. Both ice and heat help the pain. I have trouble sleeping and activity seems to make it worse. I've been referred to both a rheumatologist and neurologist by my family doctor, and she is really quite stumped.   Has anyone else ever experienced any similar symptoms?

I wake up in the morning very stiff, and the joint pain worsens over the course of the day. The pain is in my wrists, ankles, elbows and knees and sometimes in my fingers. The aching and stiffness will increase, and then the pain will flare-up. The pain in the joint feels tingly and burning, and it doesn\'t feel superficial. It radiates through the joint. It feels like I\'ve sat too close to a fire inside my joints. Moving does not help the pain. I can still do daily tasks but slower and I am usually exhausted by the end of it.  After an allergic reaction to azithromycin, I got serum sickness when I was 14. The dull ache and persistent pain is the best way to compare the pain. It does not feel like an injury, exercise soreness or flu-like.  In addition to the joint pain, I\'ve had a headache, It appears to act similarly to the joint pain. I wake up with it, and at first, it feels like a caffeine withdrawal headache. However, caffeine doesn\'t change it. The headache is persistent and achy and it escalates to a stabbing sensation, in bouts of usually 3-5 ""stabs"". I have had this headache for 12 days now.  There is no visible swelling or redness in or around the joints.  I\'ve considered a food sensitivity and kept a log of my pain, what I\'ve eaten and the drugs I took. I can\'t seem to find any patterns.  I\'ve been taking 2 Aleve in the morning and 1 at night, Tylenol intermittently and topical treatments such as Voltaren and Tiger Balm. Both ice and heat help the pain. I\'ve also been taking turmeric pills for potential inflammation. My mind feels clear, and I feel completely healthy otherwise. I am usually healthy. The pain has ranged from a 3/10 to a 7/10. I have woken up in the night in pain from my joints aching. Nothing has sufficiently helped the pain.  My doctor ordered blood tests and they were negative for infection, cancer markers, RA and lupus markers. My MCH is low (but close to normal range) and my RDW is high (and also close to normal range). However, my ferritin, B12 and hemoglobin levels are all within the normal range.  I drink occasionally, I don\'t smoke and I use cannabis occasionally.  I really appreciate your help, I\'m perplexed."

While it's not hard to do well if you're politically minded, if you're only taking it to get into law school or something, you'll probably struggle.

If there are follow up visits or if you need more medical attention that arose because of your slip, I'd include that too. Did you get pictures of the location of your slip? If not, I'd do that ASAP.   Postal workers slip on the job and they sue. With a private institution like UTM, with a high volume of people, there is a high expectation that ice and snow will be cleared within a reasonable amount of time.

I\'m a sub and being on top is very submissive if your goal is to do what your Master says."

You're pretty disgusting. I'm sure other people have watched you wipe your snotty nose on your sweater and no one made a Reddit post about the racist with the snotty sleeve. Or sat beside you in the library and smelled your foul body odour and bad breath.   That kind of language isn't okay, and you disgust me more than any girl eating her lunch with loud music ever could. I hope you realize that you probably should get a diary or something, because no one wants to hear your stupid, racist bullshit."

Otherwise, some courses offer FSG (facilitated study groups) which may be useful. Like other other people said, you should check out the RGASC in MN. Also, I might suggest talking to an academic advisor. They're really nice at the registrar and will help you. Reaching out to your profs and TAs IS scary but I think it'll give you some real insight.   I'm assuming you're in first year. Remember that it's ok to change paths. If the courses you're taking are not something that you care about, you're definitely going to find it more difficult to engage with the material."

It's a lazy thing and paraphrasing will help you understand more in the long-run and you'll sound like you know what you're talking about. I'm in the humanities/social sciences and I've never submitted a paper over 10% similarity. Talk to your TA and prof ASAP. If you're struggling with writing or paraphrasing or citing your sources, go to the RGASC. It's in MN. The librarians are also really helpful with citations."

I was freaking out about taking all the second year requirements in second year and I had multiple conflicts. I went to an academic advisor and they set me up all swell for second year. I think what is most important is to take the courses that are pre-requisites for upper year courses first instead of classes that you're particularly interested in. Get the boring stuff out of the way and then enjoy the rest of your years on the foundation that boring first and second year pre-reqs gave you.

In my experience, philosophy has been the harder major just on the basis of the writing that is required. Both majors/minors will entail a lot of reading but the writing in philosophy is quite different compared to any other kind of academic writing. I quite enjoyed POL113 which is essentially an introduction to political philosophy. PHL101/102/103 (whichever) are good baseline philosophy courses. They don't go too in depth but the grading on writing can be quite harsh. A lot of POL classes are Y classes in upper years whereas in my experience PHL are mostly H. Good luck! If I were you, I would probably do POL113 and PHL103. Good luck! If you have questions I'd be happy to answer. :-)"
