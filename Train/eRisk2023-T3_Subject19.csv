There certainly are many people who are faking trauma for that reason. That's undeniable.   However, there are a lot of factors that you failed to consider which could cause serious trauma. Some of them are:  -Lifestyle, especially people who were very physically or socially active  -Some people lack the knowledge or ability to use technology to socialize   -The whole pandemic started very abruptly and completely changed most people's lives, schedules, plans, etc.  -For some people lockdown meant being with an abusive partner/family member/roommate 24/7  -Being with someone 24/7 is unhealthy and can turn healthy relationships into unhealthy (abusive or codependent) ones  -Fear + having nothing to distract yourself with = anxiety  There are many more factors, but it'd be impractical to list all."

I can\'t speak for all autistic people but I can give a different perspective on that.   >Wouldnt social banning of a word just give it more inherent power?  I see why one would assume that but no, it doesn\'t give it more power. For a word to be seen as banned by society there has to be some sort of agreement by a significant portion of society that said word is harmful enough to warrant that.   Banning (or socially suppressing) the usage of a word takes power away from those who use it, because using the word turns them into a target. Think of bullying scenes in movies, where the bully insults someone and everyone laughs at the person. Now imagine instead of everyone laughing most people getting mad at the bully.    >words such as ""retard"" are used mostly as a synonym as slow, dumb, etc - wouldnt it make more sense to just accept societies attempt to move the word away from relations of mental disorders?  No, because that\'s what it means. It means someone lacks intelligence. When you use it as an insult directed at a person who doesn\'t have a developmental or learning disability because they did something wrong you are implicitly equating doing that to having a disability. Using it as an insult implies that being \'slow\' or \'dumb\' are character flaws and that \'slow\' or \'dumb\'people are inferior."

Anyways, my therapist ripped him a new one, which helped a lot  I got older and stronger.

Well, I guess it's not false but I wouldn't call it true either.   Homeostasis isn't really a term used in regard to disabilities, it's usually associated with (as in being absent or altered in) illness and physiological imbalances  Disabilities can cause and be caused by illnesses, but they're not the same thing. Illness is a term linked to health, while disability is a term linked to functionality/autonomy  For example, P has a physical disability and doesn't have the mobility and strength to feed themselves. P's caretaker dies, leaving them with no help to eat. P will get sick and eventually starve to death.   Starvation (which is a disruption of homeostasis) is the cause of P's death. If P had had help (either from a person or from accessibility equipment/technology) they wouldn't have died.   >How would you rebuke this argument  Needing help and accessibility =/= living inside someone and literally getting nutrients from their blood."

The study you linked to was retracted because of methodological concerns: [https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/15/7754/htm](https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/15/7754/htm)  About side effects: Up to 90% of vaccinated individuals reported having side effects, but if you remove the ""headache"", ""pain in injection site"", ""dizziness"", ""heaviness on injection arm"", ""rash"" and other similar (as in an annoyance rather than a health risk), it drops to less than 0.5%, with the majority of these less than 0.5% being anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction)   [https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/article-abstract/2787361](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/article-abstract/2787361)  [https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/10/8/1419/htm#B7-healthcare-10-01419](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9032/10/8/1419/htm#B7-healthcare-10-01419)  Many of these anaphylaxis cases were in people who had severe allergies to medications or autoimmune disorders  I\'m definitely not an expert in either medicine or ethics, so this is just an opinion:   If someone refuses to take a vaccine that helps prevent COVID cases and deaths because of stuff like arm pain or headaches for less than 5 days without any real, statistically significant risk, that person should not be allowed in public places.   If the person has a medical condition that means taking the vaccine is an actual risk, I wouldn\'t judge them for not taking it, but anything other than that is, in my opinion, morally unacceptable."

There's a huge difference between those two. There's the obvious consent part but theres also many physical differences. When someone gets a circumcision as an adult, their penis is already fully developed and the foreskin is detached from the glans, which isn't the case in newborns. There's a lot of difference in how this affects sensation, both because of the glans being exposed to more tactile input while it develops and because of the way scar tissue works.   I'm not saying your experience is wrong or that you are lying in any way. I'm just saying that those are completely different things and your experience can be different from other adult circumcisions and is definitely different from most if not all newborn circumcisions.  That being said, I do think that comparing it to FGM is going too far and imo intelectually dishonest"

Many others had their parents\' legally bought guns that had been stored inappropriately (bc, y\'know, most law abiding people don\'t think their children will go on killing sprees if they get access to guns).  >Criminals break laws  This simultaneously sounds very obvious yet is incredibly stupid and to be honest pretty disgusting in this context. There\'s way more nuance to the term ""criminals"", to the laws they break and to the social, psychological and societal contexts that lead to people (bc remember, criminals are people too) committing crimes.   Most people incarcerated in the US are locked up because of non-violent drug-related crimes. A lot of them have a way easier access to illegal gun dealers than the average person, yet they didn\'t go on killing sprees.   This isn\'t a ""maniacs who have a lot of involvement with organized crime (such as illegal dealing of guns) and randomly want to mass murder"" issue.   These shooters are usually very young people who are socially isolated, feel betrayed by society, are psychologically and emotionally unstable, brew their bitterness towards society in echo-chamber online forums (so basically people that should definitely not have access to guns) and *have very easy (and legal) access to guns that can kill a lot of people in a very short time. Not hunting rifles, not self defense concealable weapons like pistols, weapons like AR-15s that have a way bigger destructive power*  Of course people are responsible for their own actions but society is definitely not guiltless in this whole issue and the lack of stricter gun regulations and tbh the gun culture in the US in itself is a huge part of the problem"

Make it clear that your mother is being abusive and that you are having suicidal thoughts.  Try to join some group activity that's supervised by an adult like a sports team, a study group or something along those lines. This can make it easier to find an adult you can trust. Keep in mind that teachers are usually mandatory reporters, so be ready for possible cps involvement.  Since you are autistic (btw does your mother acknowledge you're autistic?) maybe you can find help in disability rights organizations or disability-specific departments in the public school system (even if you're homeschooled) or other similar stuff  I hope some of this info helps. Being a teenager is tough. Being an autistic teenager with an abusive parent is even tougher (been there, it sucks). It does tend to get better once you become an adult tho.   Try to look at your current situation as an obstacle you need to get through in order to get to your actual life once you get your freedom. Keep yourself busy with stuff you like, try to stay as healthy as possible and remember that this is all temporary.

If anything a person taking PrEP is actively being safe and should be seen as more likely to not have HIV. PEP idk, bc it\'s not really a prevention, it\'s like the day after pill but for HIV (and isn\'t 100% chance of working) so if a person has taken it multiple times they are probably having unsafe sex.  Not screening for other types of sex is not only very discriminatory but also dangerous af.

I'm not a woman but I'm a trans guy with the same genitalia as a woman and I'm asexual. I actually had an agreement with my gf (also trans, has a dick) that she could fuck me while I slept bc I didn't care and she'd be able to have sex without me having to actively participate. Now our relationship is open and the few times we fuck it's with me not being mentally present (I just play on my phone or something like that)  Most of my woman friends have drunk sex agreements with their partners. Some have asleep sex agreements (mostly bc of kinks). Some get psychedelic drugs specifically to enhance sex. Most of my gay men friends have those agreements too.   Power fantasies are not exclusive to men and submission fantasies exist.  That being said, getting someone drunk/drugging them so they will consent when otherwise they wouldn't is rape and fucking someone while they sleep without them specifically consenting to that (and setting limits to it) is also rape.  >If somebody a person consents to have sex while he or she is unconscious - the moment he/she is unconscious and the other person has sex with him it becomes rape  This type of blanket statement trivializes rape and helps nobody. Rape is a very serious crime with very severe mental consequences to the victim and should be treated as such"

I don't think it's reasonable to not save someone when the resource needed for that is available and is going to be disposed of otherwise.  I think corpses shouldn't have rights. They're not people. As far as rights go imo it should be the same as an object.  Necrophilia is disgusting, but not because it's a human body. Fucking a dead animal's carcass is just as disgusting.   Imo you're fucked up if you fuck rotting stuff and you're fucked up if someone you know dies and you're more concerned about fucking than the fact that they're dead.

In most places the will supercedes the family in basically everything that happens to the corpse and the estate. So if it is specified in the will that the body can be used for sexual purposes the act is consensual.   However, there's still a huge issue regarding biohazard (for example you can't just keep your grandma's body rotting away in your living room even if it's in the will). That depends on a lot of stuff tho and I am not qualified to give a science-based opinion nor am I able to give an unbiased opinion.  So, basically, it's not always morally wrong but it's very gross.   Please don't fuck dead bodies  I'm gonna go puke now"

That being said, I'm against necrophilia bc of biohazard (aka it's gross and can potentially spread diseases) and bc it would mean a lot of government resources being wasted regulating it. Oh and bc it would be a huge smell problem if a neighbor kept a decomposing body to fuck.   That being said I don't think you should be criminally prosecuted for having sex with someone who is dying (and consented while alive) and keep going when they die bc you're too high to notice they're dead.

There are many things that can lead to addictions, and experimenting with drugs is definitely one of the possible causes but not the only one. Addiction is often secondary to other mental disorders. Depression, bipolar disorder, personality disorders and ADHD have particularly high chances of leading to addiction. Other than that there\'s also peer pressure (mostly with teens), prescribed drugs turning into addictions, using drugs for a ""functional"" purpose (such as amphetamines to study for tests or to stay awake at work) and that turning into an addiction, etc.  That being said, imo being an addict definitely doesn\'t give you a moral free pass to stealing or hurting other people in any way. Addiction itself is not the person\'s fault, but stealing is. If you know you are prone to losing control while high, it is your responsibility to keep yourself from affecting other people who have nothing to do with your addiction."

Criminally insane people, usually people with ASPD (though most people with ASPD are not dangerous!!), have a different pattern. They usually carefully plan the crime, do it and then if police asks them if they did it they confess and even add details to what the police knows bc they are proud of it and they feel no shame or guilt for what they did.

I had early puberty and took puberty blockers (gnrh agonist) from 8 to 11yo, went through female puberty and started hormonal female to male transition (gel for 1 year, now slow release trimestral shots) at 17 (August 2019).  I have recently been diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. The type is still unknown (genetic sequencing not ready yet) but it is either hypermobile, vascular, classical-like or classical, in this order of probability (according to the rheumatologist). My beighton score is 9/9 and my joint hypermobility is worse on my lower limbs (but present in my whole body).  Right before I started T the endocrinologist had me do blood tests and hand x-rays. I asked him if there was any chance of me growing in heigh or foot size and he said it was basically impossible because my bones were already fully developed.  When I started T I was 5\'4"", now I\'m 5\'6"", so small difference there, but my feet were size 5.5(male chart), now they\'re size 9. I can\'t even put old shoes on, it won\'t even squeeze in.  My endocrinologist was quite puzzled at the time and said he didn\'t know why I had grown. I haven\'t been there in a couple of months, so I haven\'t been able to ask him if it could be because of the increased joint laxity caused by EDS, but in any case there\'s probably less than 20 people with EDS in the city I live in (Not in the US btw) and the chance of the endocrinologist having ever had or heard about another trans patient with EDS are very small. My mom\'s a gastroenterologist and in almost 25 years of career she has never had a patient with EDS even though it causes GI issues.  Does anyone have any ideas if that could be a factor?"

When my dog pukes and my gf isn't home (when she's home she cleans it and I do some of her chores in return) I don't leave my dog and floor marinating in vomit, I endure the panic attack and clean it. It's obviously distressing for me but leaving my dog and house dirty is just not an option.   I chose to have a dog, therefore I have to deal with the negative parts of having a dog.

I mentioned above just the surgeries and things in general that the puberty blockers would eliminate the need for. Genital surgeries aren't there bc hormones won't make your penis fall off or your vulva turn into a penis  ETA: the death risk associated to puberty blockers is just the same as almost every other substance: risk of anaphylactic allergic reaction. The side effects are literally the effects of not having puberty and it can potentially worsen some kinds of prostate cancer and cause malformation to a fetus if the person taking them is pregnant.

There are a couple of cases where a person whose biological father left the person's mother during pregnancy meets their father after decades and begins a relationship. I don't see anything wrong with that. It gets more complicated if there was a parent-child relationship at some point.  About the biohazard aspects of beastiality, necrophilia and cannibalism: there isn't much direct study on any of those for ethical reasons,  most of the studies that do exist are either based in other species or based in data gathered from known cases, almost none of which were in a controlled environment, so not very reliable. Also, it would depend a lot on the amount of people doing it.  It's very difficult to know whether there would be interspecies transmission of STDs if a lot of people started having sex with their dogs. It's not only uncommon for people to do that, it is also extremely unlikely that someone would admit to doing it, so there isn't much data about it. There's also the risk of infections that aren't STDs but are increased when you have sex with an animal bc of the contact of fluids.  Necrophilia has the decomposition factor, so it isn't just a matter of diseases transmitted through the sex itself, there's also the risk of many other types of infections. Bodies start decomposing very quickly and it's not the same in every body.  (I'm not mentioning the stuff about family bc that's way more complex and there's a whole debate about who should have the power over what happens to the body).  Cannibalism is probably the most problematic in terms of biohazard because diseases that spread through eating can become a really big problem really fast. All food industries have very strict regulations (meat even more so) so that food is safe to eat, and that's not possible if you're eating another human who had autonomy and lived their live in a not controlled environment. Many places don't even allow cattle to be fed any animal products bc of the risk of zoonosis. Human cannibalism is rare so there aren't many studies about the diseases one could get from eating human meat and/or internal organs.  Both cannibalism and necrophilia also have added risks depending on how much contact with the body the person doing those things has and some additional risks depending on whether the body has been embalmed (mostly for necrophilia, I don't think people that are into cannibalism would want to eat an embalmed body), how the person died, how much time has passed since the person died and many, many more things that increase or decrease the risk (and some might increase the risk at a personal level but decrease at a society level or vice versa). There's no way of knowing everything the person did in life and, well, you can't exactly ask a corpse whether they had any diseases.   There's also the thing about regulating all of this, which would be very difficult to do."

eRisk2023-T3_Subject19, b' ' , b'2022-03-23 07:49:04' , reddit post ,"In my point of view those are all very different when it comes to ethics, so I\'ll explain my views on each separately.  Incest: firstly, there\'s a difference between something like parent-child incest and sibling-sibling incest.   When there\'s a difference in power, like in a parent-child relationship, true consent can\'t be given because of that power imbalance. Parents (in general, obviously there are exceptions) are authority figures to their children and they have a very significant influence in their children\'s opinions, so there will always be *some* level of influence on the decision to have sex with them.   When the incest is between siblings (or cousins or other ""same level"" relations), there can still be a power imbalance that is directly proportional to the difference in age and there\'s the issue with the possibility of having children together (birth control can fail, condoms can break, so not necessarily intentionally having children) bc of recessive genetic disorders, but other than that it\'s mostly cultural and in my opinion not *inherently* unethical (I think it\'s weird af but not objectively unethical).   Bestiality: again, imo there\'s 2 categories. Female animals (or penetrating male animals) and being penetrated by a male animal.  In both categories the animal can\'t consent, that\'s already a reason for it to be unethical.  The first category also has the issue that not every animal can communicate pain, discomfort and things like that and can\'t understand consequences.  Also, it\'s unhygienic and has a lot of potential for interspecies transmission and generation of STDs, so it\'s a huge biohazard.   Necrophilia (when consented before death): extremely unhygienic, potential biohazard in many ways but imo not inherently unethical in terms of the corpse itself (still unethical bc biohazard affects society)   Cannibalism depends on if the person is alive or not.   If not alive (and not being killed for that specific reason) same issues as necrophilia   If alive there\'s a whole ethical dilemma regarding one\'s ability to consent to being killed or having pieces cut off. Mostly, if a person is willing to consent, they certainly have a serious mental disorder and are therefore unable to give consent.   If it involves the killing of the person there\'s also the added layer of practical issues regarding proving that the person agreed to it (which they can\'t bc if they do that means they\'re not mentally able to so no consent)"

Disabled kids have a right to education in the least restrictive setting, and not every disability that impacts behavior impacts learning and vice versa, so other than having a classroom for each individual student there's no way of having a special ed class in which everyone learns to their full capacity.

You can cause damage by many means, (many of which are not crimes), and you can commit a crime and not cause/be liable for damages (for example in some victimless crimes).   >so actually knowing if you even did something wrong or not  The thing is that it is impossible to be 100% sure in most, if not all, cases. Therefore, the law has to establish criteria for either conviction (criminal) or liability (civil).  The criteria is stricter for criminal court because it involves taking a right (freedom) from a person. In a case that goes to both criminal and civil court the ruling on either case is not dependent on the other.   An example: You trespass on a property that belongs to a company and destroy the handrails of a staircase. Let's say one of the workers there saw that the handrails were destroyed, dismissed that information and decided to still climb the stairs, even though there were other possible routes, and got injured. It is clear you committed a crime. It is also clear that you are liable for the damage to the handrails. The injury is more complicated though, because you didn't force the worker to climb those stairs. Even if you are convicted in criminal court, civil court can rule that you are only liable for the handrails.   About the evidence, both courts have to have evidence to make a decision. The only difference is that the criminal court has to have evidence beyond a reasonable doubt (so anything that leaves a doubt results in not guilty) and the civil court has to have evidence enough that the possibility that you caused the damage is greater than the possibility that you didn't (so a 90% certainty wouldn't impede a ruling in favor of the person being sued)"

The law in civil court isn't different for a crime vs an infraction bc the crime itself is the criminal court's responsibility to judge.

The case in a civil court isn't just about whether the act was committed, it is also about the damages it possibly caused and the dimension of the damages."

It doesn't matter what the case is.   In criminal court the evidence has to be beyond reasonable doubt (aka the evidence leaves no doubt that the person is guilty) bc the consequences of a conviction are way more life-altering and irreversible than civil court.  In civil court you still have to prove it, but there is more margin for error bc it's just money, not years of someone's freedom being taken away.

Now we know that usually there's no need to test IQ unless the person has an intellectual disability (or disorders that increase the risk of having it) or are performing distinctly above their age group's average in school. There's very little difference in what a person with an IQ of 85 and a person with an IQ of 115 usually achieve in life.

Oh and they can just blow the smoke into a hoodie sleeve. Stupid rules just make teens create new ways to hide rule-breaking.  Also, putting an optic smoke detector in a bathroom is just stupid. People use aerosol deodorants, hot water creates vapor, cleaning sprays can set the detector off."

Most of my friends are my handball teammates, who are all late teen/young adult males. While I do think some (and by some I mean way too many) men just don't give a fuck I can see a couple other factors there:  1- sex ed is very substandard even when it comes to vaginal sex, it's pretty much non-existent when it comes to anal sex. Even more so in more religious places.  2- a lot of guys think that just bc large poop can get out, a large penis can get in with the same ease.  3- pornography makes it all seem like rainbows and butterflies, completely painless and easy. Also, the more extreme kinds of pornography make it seem like things like extremely large dildos and fists are easy to insert.  4- some guys think anal sex is a kink that inherently involves pain, like bdsm, and that if their partner is into anal sex then they are into pain. Anal sex is still viewed as non-standard sex by lots of people.   5- lack of education about afab bodies makes some guys think that if vaginal sex is painless and oral sex is also painless then anal sex will be painless too. Most straight men (and a lot of active gay men too) have never inserted anything in their anuses, so they have no idea about what anal sex feels like in the receiving end.   That being said, I want to make clear that I do think most of these issues come from sexism (and homophobia too bc a lot of people think anal sex is for gay men), but imo they're more of a society issue than an issue with those specific men."

I have a service dog that is trained to help me with sensory overloads, PTSD flashbacks, alert to migraines and get help when I fall (amongst other stuff).   My mom has a Labrador who gets along super well my SD but when they play with each other she sheds a lot of hair. She is not well trained at all and won\'t stop trying to play with him, even when he\'s working.  My family usually gathers every weekend to have lunch together. We used to do that in my grandma\'s house bit because of the pandemic we are now doing it in my mom\'s house.   I usually take my service dog pretty much everywhere with me and that has significantly decreased the frequency in which I have to take my emergency panic attack meds (which are benzos so really strong meds). My mom however doesn\'t like the mess that her dog and my SD make when they\'re together and said I can\'t bring him to the lunches at her house. I tried to offer to host the lunches at my place but she said that that won\'t work because it\'s too small. I suggested a number of other options, including keeping her dog in the crate and having lunch somewhere else but she insists on her house and said I don\'t need to bring him because ""It\'s just a couple of hours and anyways why would you have a panic attack here?"".  This is really bothering me and I\'m seriously considering the possibility of just stopping to go altogether but my mom would get really offended and it would significantly reduce the amount of time I spend with her (other than that we get along super well). Would I be the asshole if I stopped going?  Edit to clarify sone stuff: My mom does care about my well being but she genuinely doesn\'t understand the disorders I have and the huge role my dog has in helping me (I\'ve tried to explain but I don\'t think she really understood). I\'ll probably get my therapist to explain all of it to her once the pandemic is over"

Backstory: I (18M) live in an apartment building. Where I live there's no such thing as pet-free housing. By law all residential areas must allow pets within reason (you can't have a cow inside an apartment). I usually leave home with my service dog unvested and put his vest on if I have to (where I live SDs must be vested and have an ID and tag)  This happened last week. I was getting my mail at a common area of the building and a lady (approx. 70 yo) was just leaving the elevator with a kid (her granddaughter) when she saw my dog. My dog is a pitbull (APBT) and is in no way or form aggressive or reactive.   This is how the conversation went:  Me: Me, EP: the lady, NK: her granddaughter   EP: NK STAY BEHIND ME THAT'S A DANGEROUS DOG!!!!  Me: Actually he's very docile and well-trained.  EP: BUT THAT'S A PITBULL, YOU CAN'T HAVE THAT THING IN HERE.  NK: I want to play with the dog!  EP: SHUT UP NK!!  Me: I can have him here, he's my dog and by law he has all the right to be here.  EP (clearly taken aback): well, by law dangerous dogs have to wear muzzles!!!  Me: that's right, but he isn't a dangerous dog and he's a service dog, his tasks can't be properly done with a muzzle and the law allows it.  EP: well, I'm in a hurry right now but next time I'll call the police and see what they have to say. (With a grin on her face)  I really, really wish she does that. If she does it I'll have her charged with harassment.  Edit: [dog tax][URL]  Edit 2: thank you for the awards and for all the kindness. Also, my dog's a he. A lot of people thought he was a female lol"

The exception is when the parent or parents are unable to take care of the child due to being incapable, when they've abused the child in some way or when they've been neglectful, but there are specific laws for that, and it doesn't require the existence of grandparent rights laws."
