I've had three full-blown LDs (where I was fully aware and could control my surroundings) in the past two weeks, and many more where I was at least aware that I was in a dream. Last night I succeeded in my first induction method (SSILD), which I won't talk about for now.  However, I have a persistent problem in these dreams: my IQ seems to decrease in half the normal amount while I'm in them. I consistently make stupid choices while I'm LDing that make me groan after I wake up, because I know I could've done something way cooler and ruined the opportunity.  The things I've attempted while I was lucid include:  -Buying a new pair of headphones so that I can bring them back to my waking life, because the ones I have irl are broken  -Summoning a bunch of food and eating them because I can't get fat if the food isn't real  -Doing laundry and washing dishes because I'm too lazy to do them in real life   So, I guess my question is: how to be less stupid while I'm dreaming? I get that you're not supposed to be in the same exact mental state as when you're awake (especially when you're still a beginner), but even though I hear all these cool stories of people flying through beautiful landscapes, summoning a dream guide, meditating etc. I never think of trying them when I'm actually in a dream, and it's honestly very frustrating. Is there a way to overcome this?"

I took Ambien during high school for my insomnia and sometimes it would give me these weird epiphanies that made no sense whatsoever after I'd sobered up, but the experience was always interesting and exhilarating. As for the philosopher, lol I don't really remember much because the dream wasn't heavily visually oriented (does that make sense?) but he certainly gave me the impression that he was just some guy who thinks he's spiritual/deep. He seemed like a cool person to hang out with though."

But I remember the guy in my dream being kind of sketchy (he gave me the impression of somebody cosplaying as a philosopher more than an actual one?) and honestly I don't remember much about Greek philosophy from that class. Am now interested in looking more into it, though!"

We decided to smoke some pot together (I've never had marijuana in my life) and after taking a hit he said, \xe2\x80\x9cRight now, I can say that a triangular circle exists. It truly exists at this moment because I have complete faith in my words, and thus I can envision it clearly.\xe2\x80\x9d So I asked him, \xe2\x80\x9cDoes that mean God exists if I believed in Him hard enough?\xe2\x80\x9d and he was like, \xe2\x80\x9cNah, that's different.\xe2\x80\x9d and then I woke up. It's been a week and I'm still thinking about it. what the actual fuck"
