I also find it fits better with my schedule to just not have to worry about eating during the day and even if I eat lunch I still have to eat before bed, so it feels like a waste to eat during the day.  I wouldn't recommend it to other people but it sort of kind of a little bit works for me sometimes. I should try eating more during the day because I think that would help me in the long run, make me bp less and make me feel better.   Atm just thinking about eating is stressful so I feel worse if I eat four X calorie meals than I do if I eat one 4X calorie meal."

Right now I'm not eating at all except for binging and purging. Trying to get out of it by trying to eat my normal restriction meals but it's not working and I keep purging everything that goes into my mouth, which in the end makes me feel like eating normal food or restrictive food is futile because I'll just purge anyway, so I eat binge food and things that makes my brain happy for a moment rather than literally anything else with nutrients or at least less guilt associated with.  I usually struggle with restriction together with binging in a much lesser way, my main problem usually is purging and restriction. I had a bad overexercising phase earlier this year that I notice I'm slipping back into.   So basically for the past two weeks I have eaten 90% junk food and like 10% fruit, while also purging almost everything I eat. I don't eat until late at night but I have to eat before bed or I will struggle falling asleep (or even binge in the middle of the night) so I end up binging and purging at night before bed so I can sleep after fasting all day. If I try to eat earlier, which I tried today, I end up purging throughout the entire day instead :)  I don't experience binging without purging or binge only periods, it is always together with some type of restriction and I always purge after binging. honestly I barely binged all summer, it's just these past two ish weeks that have been hell.  I have restrictive phases where I don't binge and only restrict and purge. I wish I could have some kind of stability in my eating but life said no [heart emoticon]"

It isn't only people who have never had an ED, a lot of recovery content online made by seemingly recovered/recovering individuals has this icky vibe when talking about active eating disorders.  I am not brainwashed, I am mentally ill.     I am not stupid, misinformed, unknowledgeable or weakminded, I have an eating disorder.     I am going through something difficult and coping with the pain my mental illness inflicts on me by engaging in disordered behaviors. That does not make me an unrelatable character who cannot be spoken to or reasoned with.   ^^^^^^^.     I do not hold brainwashed irrational beliefs, I know it's all my eating disorder making me believe, think, fear, panic and react the things/the way I do. If I one day recover and no longer have a fear of bread, that does not make me a better person with more brain power. It makes me less disordered person with less bread induced pain in my life. But it's not and will never be because I intellectually came to the realization that bread isn't horrible and outgrew my eating disorder.  I already know bread isn't horrible but I still can't eat it without intense guilt and disordered behaviors.  I know people probably do not intend to make current ED sufferers feel infantilized, stupid and uninformed when they talk in a way that makes it sound like all you need to do to recover is to realize something, but it's honestly the vibe that gets picked up by me.  Also I understand that this is a bit vague but maybe people can relate, idk. And obviously I don't want to invalidate people who have struggled with an ED who genuinely feel like they were brainwashed by their ED, I just don't relate at all and it low key annoys me when it's implied that that's the case for everyone.  I guess in the end what I want to say is that people tend to talk about eating disorders in a way that I don't like because it makes me, as someone who is currently sick, feel like they think I am not on the same mental level as they are and that is why I am sick, when in reality I know that bread isn't evil, my exercise goals are arbitrary and ineffective, and throwing up food isn't \xe2\x9c\xa8healthy\xe2\x9c\xa8, but my disordered brain cannot let go of behaviors, thoughts and fears because it is a mental disorder. I am incredibly self aware but self awareness itself does not cure eating disorders. ok thanks bye rant over"

eRisk2023-T3_Subject14," b'the watering down of the term ""eating disorder"" makes for a very weird personal relationship to my own ED.' ", b'2022-02-21 20:06:33' , reddit post ,"it\'s hard to put into words but what i mean is that the term eating disorder is thrown around a lot, both in real life and online, in regard to any weight loss situation or anything. it\'s like it has stopped being a group of mental illnesses but rather a descriptor of relatively harmless to harmful behaviors and thoughts that could be disordered as part of a larger issue but on their own do not signify a mental illness diagnosis.   it\'s like the way people say ""i\'m so OCD, i wash my hands a lot!"" or ""i\'m depressed because i have homework"" - obviously someone with OCD can wash their hands a lot and someone living with depression can feel way worse due to a huge workload, but on its own it\'s silly and harmful to claim math homework causes clinical depression or OCD is the same as being clean.   i know people struggle with feeling invalidated in their ed and it\'s not my intention to invalidate anyone who struggles, however severe or minor their issues are. but i think it has become an authentic problem when so many people out of nowhere claim to have a mental illness for... clout? validation? acceptance from others? i don\'t know.  now, there is a huge difference between going undiagnosed and not having a disorder. i don\'t want to bring up the ed equivalents of ""homework causes depression"" because i think it serves no point other than invalidating people who may or may not struggle on a larger scale. my issue isn\'t with specific individuals talking about food struggles or disordered habits but rather the larger scale problem of questionable claims online about eating disorders and what they mean, imply and result in.  ok so to the point of this post: i think this ""watering down"" of eating disorders has affected me personally in what i consider normal and my own position relative to being normal about food. as i\'m writing this i realize the issue may lie in me normalizing my own habits but i still think it\'s at least supported by *everyone* in certain non-ED communities talking about having an unspecified ED (not EDNOS, i mean literally unspecified as in only classified as ""an eating disorder"" no more no less).  idk this might be a harmful take but i think it\'s evident that at least claiming to have an eating disorder is becoming so normal online, especially on TikTok (the renaissance of early 2010s Tumblr) and i personally find that to come with a LOT of problems. what do you all think?"
