I had horrible chest pain, cough, shortness of breath, palpitations, and meds have really helped.  I also work in the health industry and research and know that using vapes can cause fluid in the lungs which can present as chest pain, and that sometimes tall skinny people get collapsed lungs out of the blue, so just be aware of that. I know that these 2 conditions you mentioned also have many of those symptoms, so it's really hard to tell. I hope that one day health insurance is free and that you get access to the resources you need for both your physical and mental health. HA is so horrible and time consuming, and draining, and I wish no one to have to deal with it on their own. I'd really keep track of your chest pain (location and scale of pain) to make sure you're okay. I don't mean to worry you at all and so so sorry if this information is triggering. I do want to add tho, if you can directly pinpoint chest pain, it's probably muscular and related to anxiety. Other physical symptoms would be hard to pin point given your build and diagnosis. I also think your body would let you know if something was really really wrong. I found that to give me piece of mind. Best of luck and know that you probably are going to be okay and no, you probably won't die from any of these things any time soon."

Obviously I feel horrible that you are dealing with this too. It's debilitating. Consumes pretty much every waking moment. I'm doing better but still struggle. But we are not alone in this! I just want my life back  "

eRisk2023-T3_Subject29, b' ' , b'2022-08-23 04:03:58' , reddit post ,"Hi there! I have such a similar experience. I had sudden onset chest pain, cough, palpitations, and shortness of breath. I thought I have COVID, tested negative, thought it was a cold, but it never went away. 2 months into having these symptoms I went to urgent care and the did EKG and chest X-ray. The EKG was borderline so they sent me to the ER. Did another EKG and ER doc was like \xe2\x80\x9cthat's normal, nothing to worry about\xe2\x80\x9d they did blood work to rule out clots or heart attack and all was normal. Overall blood panel was also normal. They said to flow up with a cardiologist just to make sure. I did that and had an ECHO done, it was normal for the most part too.   My history of medical issues are that I have severe allergies and asthma. So I worried something else was happening. I'm a fairly athletic person and have always been. Before these \xe2\x80\x9cheart health\xe2\x80\x9d related scares I have stopped exercising as much as I used to. I used to bike like 130 miles a week and climb 10 hours. So I was pretty fit. But now I can hardly do a 30 min bike ride without feeling like my heart os going to pop out of my chest. And now I also OBSESS over my heart rate. It now is really low, like my RHR is 44-53 bpm (used to be about 56-61bpm). The doctors all say it just anxiety, but these physical symptoms absolutely kill me and make me feel like it is not at all \xe2\x80\x9cjust anxiety\xe2\x80\x9d. It's so hard.  I must also note that I have anxiety and OCD and have been on and off medications for 11 years. I'm 26 now.   I recently started taking lexapro again and started therapy. I think it has helped with the obsessive thoughts.   All this is to say, you are not alone in these thoughts and symptoms. I have found that doing mild to moderate exercise, and stretching, and breathing techniques to really help.   I wish you to find peace in all this, but I think you'll be okay. I know how hard it is but just focus on trying to do what will help you feel good and that you are doing the best you know you c an do right now."

eRisk2023-T3_Subject29, b'Side effects' , b'2022-08-22 19:23:13' , reddit post ,"Hi all! I've been on 5mg for about 20 days now. At first I didn't have any side effects, but about a week ago I started to get some. I am very tired (also noticed poor sleep at night), very gassy, bloated, and have loose stools a few times in the mornings. I also noticed my resting heart rate decrease about 5bmp.   Has anyone else had the GI or heart rate side effects? I know lots of people report the fatigue\xe2\x80\xa6  Just feel worried about the side effects and it's hard not to overreact to them.   Thanks all!"

eRisk2023-T3_Subject29, b' ' , b'2022-08-18 19:41:54' , reddit post ,"I have the same experience. I too am pretty active, don't use substances (as they are triggering for me), and eat pretty healthy. I think what really has helped me is really thinking about what I am going to say before I say it. I have bad anxiety and OCD. Sometimes it's hard for me to read situations correctly, and get into trouble from it. I found that reading some mindfulness/self help books were a good starting place. I've been on and off meds for years. Recently started lexapro again and it's really helpful. I experience the same thing where I ruminate on a conversation/reaction and can't stop thinking about what happened and how it could have been different or what I did wrong. I'm starting therapy again to help with these thoughts and to see if there are reasons why I have these social anxieties and how to be more mindful. It's tough. But just recognizing it is a great start! Maybe talk to your doc about meds, and if it's feasible try therapy too!"

eRisk2023-T3_Subject29, b' ' , b'2022-08-08 05:39:30' , reddit post ,"I had sudden onset symptoms just like these. Chest pain, cough, SOB. These symptoms started in March and I'm still having them. I suffer from asthma and severe allergies, so for me it could be that. I'm still very anxious about it as I have these symptoms every single day. For 4 months. I would suggest seeing a doctor. I got a lot of tests done and got a diagnosis. Seeing doctors is helpful if you have the resources to do so. But my diagnosis explains some symptoms and isn't life threatening or anything serious. I have daily heart palpitations as well. So it super scary. I've had anxiety and OCD my entire life. Many of my family members do too. I've been on and off different meds for about 10 years now. I thought I'd be good without them but I'm really not. And that's okay. They really do help. I started taking new meds again. And I think they will help again. If you feel comfortable taking meds, you should give it a try.   Try not to be scared as it could make your symptoms worse. Just know our bodies deal with physical and mental stress in sooo many ways. If you are scared, and can, go see a doctor. And really advocate for yourself."
