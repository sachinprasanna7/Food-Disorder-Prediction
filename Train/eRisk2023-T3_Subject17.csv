Why would she just look like a woman and not a man dressed like a woman, but he would look like a man dressed like a woman?  I think you'll have a hard time coming off as not straight if you specifically do a couple's costume with 2 people, where one must be femme and one must be masc, and play off each other as a pair, especially if you accentuate differences in your bodies. Those are straight ideals, cues that straight people use to find others like them. Binary centrism that treats femininity as the flipside of masculinity, traits that must be balanced with each other.  Both of my partners are different gender than me, as a nonbinary person, but we treat them like gay, same gender relationships, so when we dress up for cons and stuff like that we emphasize similarity in gender. We have a schoolgirl gang costume that we do and we're also going to dress lolita. I think both of those are also archetyped gender expressions that help an audience go beyond making the connection of femininity > woman.  I liked the other commenter's idea of vaudeville style mixing masc and femme traits in both of you. You can take that idea into any costume you choose. And maybe you can take some inspiration from drag, including techniques that AFAB queens or drag kings use. Or what about gender swapping the characters themselves? He plays female Mario, she plays Prince Peach; she plays Mario, he plays Bowsette, if being a male female character pair is easier for you."

I also grew up with a really open parent and struggled when I met my in-laws who judged me for my class and background, and I felt they blamed me for the way my partner and I lived as adults. Experiencing oppression from within your family is a very different and more vulnerable position than just from general society.  It was very kind of you to offer to come out to your bf's parents before him, so please don't feel guilty for it. Try to look at it like your bf's dad is the one responsible for his own anger and making sure he doesn't bring harm to his family. It isn't your existence or coming out that is the problem.  I also think it's so normal to tell the siblings first before the parents, those siblings are probably your peers and have way less power over the two of you than the father has."

If this is the first or one of a few times you said you don\'t consider your deadname to be a valid name for you, I think it\'s good to check you\'re both on the same page after any tough feelings about this incident calm down. It could be active disregard or it could be a miscommunication that your partner is happy to clear up.  In addition to that, it concerns me that your partner doesn\'t use your pronouns because he doesn\'t ""like"" them. Your pronouns wouldn\'t normally be someone else\'s choice or open to someone else\'s opinion. This seems a bit like a broader effort to avoid dealing with your transition."

You\'re expressing that it\'s natural, normal, and expected that we\'re misgendered, just for dressing and looking how we want to.  If I described my presentation, I would definitely not see it as in-line with my assigned gender at all. I pick specific clothes, I style my body, I behave myself in a way to deliberately express my neutral gender. Yet I have never, ever been mistaken for anything except my assigned gender. I\'m sure that everyone sees my choices as normative, but or me they are purposefully rejecting of my assigned gender.  Is ""femme presenting"" a label that those nonbinary people have chosen for themselves? Or is it an interpretation of their gender that you\'ve put upon them? I find it weird that people label my presentation in direct opposition of my gender. All my presentation is in-line with my gender identity and not my assigned gender, all the time, unless I have to present otherwise for my safety.

I did wonder if you just lived in an area where that kind of discrimination was particularly wide-spread.  My skillset allows me to self-employ, which is how I personally make ends meet (plus I am polyamourous and share costs with two partners). I don't know if self employment is viable at all in the education industry, but it's a way I avoid some of the usual restrictions of capitalism.  It certainly isn't fair that we don't have access to things others would take for granted, but I try to see it as doing what l need to do rather than what's nice or good, and that alleviates some of the pain that comes with living as a minority for me, personally.

That disqualifies people unless they have sexual experience with both *binary* sides of the gender spectrum, plus not having a nonbinary option may cause male and female to be interpreted as the *sex* as opposed to gender of a partner.  The survey goes back and forth on including or excluding nonbinary people throughout the whole thing. There is also one section that just refers to ""partners"" and not sex partners, leaving it ambiguous whether you\'re talking about sexual experience or romantic partnerships. That part coincidentally includes nonbinary partners, and happens to be right before a huge section that only asks about binary genders.  There are questions about sexual assault that specifically ask about men with specific body parts, ignoring any other gender or anybody with any other body part...  You\'re going to have a lot of difficulty drawing conclusions when the data you have is mixed as it is."
eRisk2023-T3_Subject17, b' ' , b'2022-10-07 23:41:08' , reddit post ,"This isn\'t nonbinary specific advice, but, the system isn\'t designed for you, or for anyone, to make a living. That\'s not the point of capitalism, which focuses on scale and business metrics over human lives. It sounds like you\'ve done ok for yourself so far working in good faith, but the system doesn\'t give back good faith.  As a coping mechanism, I would suggest not looking to your job and career of evidence of whether you are ""welcome"" or not. It\'s a natural connection for someone to make, but an employer is not a family or a safe space, they\'re a provider of resources.  I\'m curious kind of bad image your boss thinks you\'re giving the business? Is it just plain old fashioned transphobia, or is it stuff you can work around? Masc presentation on afab people can come off as unprofessional, if you presented more traditionally classy could that change people\'s impression of you? Supposedly you are working with children, is it a concern about how parents will react to you? Everyone acts differently at work than they do in their normal lives, so maybe there are things you can do without giving up your gender presentation.   I have definitely presented in more normative ways to try to be successful at work, but I don\'t think you should do that if it\'s unsustainable or harmful to you. If you haven\'t, it would be a good idea to think about what\'s necessary for you to have in an employer and what can be negotiated. Job searching will always be an act of compromise."

The people who use this fact to oppress us are the problem. you're not doing anything wrong by just trying to figure yourself out.  I can't say that relate to the bulk of your post, but I am synesthetic and I have a color association with gender similar to yours, unfortunate as it may be for me to assign the stereotypical colors of pink for women and blue for men. I feel colorless, but I sense a presence where my gender is, if that makes sense.

They probably need some time to recover from the last 2 weeks, so check if the soil is dry now, but otherwise not much needs to be done at the moment.  You can give more water when the first couple inches of soil feels dry. Wet the soil all the way through to the bottom until the water drips out the holes in the pot.  If you want to pretty them up you can go through and cut off any leaves and stem parts that are brown or soft and mushy. These are vines so you can also get a support like a moss pole and tie them so they grow vertical, or let them hang down like they are now.

How exactly do you water it, is there an inlay in the basket so the water can drain or something like that? I can\'t see the holes in the pot too well so I\'m thinking it may be getting too much water. When you say ""dry to the touch"" is it just the top or do you check deep in the pot?  The other thing could be a difference in light, maybe it got more light at its previous home. If you\'d rather have it on the ground you could get a moss pole or other kind of support to tie it up, or you could try propagating some of the longer vines.  A couple weeks also isn\'t much in plant time, it\'s probably still settling in. I got a monstera from a friend too and it was struggling, turned out she had kept in a closet prior to moving.

It was a paradoxical feeling, being my assigned gender felt ""right"" in a way that was wrong and being comfortable as that gender felt disturbing.   I am pretty certain I am nonbinary, and I want to be nonbinary, and that\'s not a bad thing. I also ended up realizing that some of these experiences were gender identity OCD -- I would spend an unnecessary amount of time thinking about these feelings and whether they made me cis or I was faking being nonbinary. That time and worry didn\'t help me or get me any closer to figuring out my identity, and since then I\'ve also had a lot of experiences of being mentally healthy without my gender fluctuating, showing that the two are not connected for me.  It would be good to think about what being cis vs nonbinary means to you. Does it control how you act or your future? How does identifying as nonbinary cause you to escape negative emotions? Do you see yourself as having a better life if you identify one way or another?  It\'s ok to change your mind or learn new things about yourself and it\'s ok to go with your feelings in the moment, and it\'s ok to not know everything all the time."

However, as a pansexual person, I agree it's problematic to show this as a universal experience. It takes away from the very real feelings of choice and personal connection to the labels we use to describe ourselves. I'm not pansexual because I have to be, I'm pansexual because I identify with the meaning, intent, and community behind the term, more than I do with bisexual.  But I think you run the risk of breaking the feeling of immersion for the book if you bring in real life issues like bi vs pan definitions. Maybe if you have the characters continue to identify as bisexual and then also use pansexual that would avoid this and let you focus more on the content of the book. A lot of people in real life do use both terms.  Based on how you wrote the post, it also seems like the nonbinary people in your book will be fantasy creatures (fairies)? I personally like the idea of nonbinary gender being portrayed as magical, but I think it's very, very unlikely that a cis person can write this well, without implying that nonbinary people are not human. You need to make sure you also have nonbinary humans that are shown as normal and regular people, equal to your other human characters."

Was it physical dysphoria or social dysphoria or both? Either way, you definitely don\'t need to have dysphoria to be nonbinary. If being nonbinary felt good or right, you don\'t have to dislike being a woman to identify as what makes you happy.  I\'m curious on how you reasoned that your identity was built this way. Was there any particular event that led you to that conclusion? Was there anyone around you who wanted you to think that way (especially since you said your parents didn\'t approve)?  I went through an experience that I feel is similar. I always had a sense that I was faking being nonbinary, when I started to question at 15, but I pushed through that because I really liked being nonbinary and wanted to be nonbinary ""even if I was faking."" When I got into a relationship with someone who didn\'t support my identity as an adult, I figured it would be more convenient to ""fake"" being my assigned gender since I was already faking being nonbinary the whole time.   But faking being my assigned gender was much harder than ""faking"" being nonbinary, lol. And here I am a decade after first questioning finally starting to feel comfortable and confident and sure in my identity and my gender-related choices.  >Once again, I feel uncomfortable with my body being seen as female   Well, bodies aren\'t gendered, and people generally are assigning gender when they see people as ""male"" or ""female,"" so maybe that is part of it. I don\'t like my body being referred to as either of these words, and that could be a boundary you held too if that was useful to you. It doesn\'t have to mean anything about your personal gender, there are both cis and trans people who think this way and try to avoid using gendered words on bodies.  >I really did have internalized misogyny, as I\'m sure most AFAB people do to some extent, and I\'ve worked through it.  I\'m glad you\'re feeling better and you\'re freer of those ideas. You can definitely hate or have oppressive misogynyst ideas about yourself without it being because you\'re a girl. Cis men hate themselves because of misogyny too, when they hate themselves for being too emotional or vulnerable or weak -- these are things society connects with women.  TL;DR You can have whatever boundaries about your body and your gender and presentation that make you comfortable. Those preferences don\'t necessarily make you a particular gender unless you feel like you are. I\'d love to have you as a fellow nonbinary if that\'s an identity that serves you."

Once you've done your part by introducing them or using the right pronouns in conversation, everything else is the responsibility of the individual person you're talking to. It doesn't reflect badly on either of you in any way when those people fail.  It's noble of you to want to help create that validating environment for them, but you can't help your partner if you're strung out yourself. The whole point of using your partner's pronouns is to validate their gender and show you support them, so maybe you can shift your focus to other things which you are responsible for.  Being in a relationship with a partner of an oppressed minority is hard no matter what. You don't need to stop oppression from happening, because you can't and no person by themselves can.

I still spend a lot of time hating myself about being incompatible with straightness, which is so unfortunate because I came out as queer way before being nonbinary.

It recontextualizes that I'm not picky or weird or fetishizing queerness, I'm just gay. All the time. That's the way I am and it's normal for me to want to be in a gay relationship.  One of the things I use to deal with heteronormative expectations is to identify exactly where it's coming from. When I see societal expectations as a nebulous force bearing down on me it's scary and it's crushing. But if it's my partner who has a heteronormative expectation, that's their mistake, that's their fault, and it would be wrong of them to change who I am at my core to fit their preferences. If it's actually me who's got the heteronormative expectation of myself, I can work on keeping that in my head and not letting that limit my behaviour.

Not sure if you are from somewhere where it is, but I\'m betting there\'s tons of americans who would be in the same situation as me that you\'re interacting with.  I feel like you are putting a lot of blame on yourself and feeling like a failure just for having thoughts. It\'s like what is happening to you is a feedback loop where what you\'re really concerned about has nothing to do with your name at all, but actually about the thoughts that you are having, about the thoughts that you are having.  You don\'t need to feel bad about being obsessive. Having OCD is not some kind of mistake or failure you made. It\'s morally neutral. Sometimes it\'s even good. You just have a brain and it does what it wants, like all brains do.   Some techniques that I see working for people are to keep obsession out of their decision making practices, to redirect obsessive thinking, to treat obsessive thinking as you would a stranger making an inappropriate comment.  I am polyamourous and one of my obsessions is the idea that I am cheating on my partners or that other people see me as a cheater. When I get those thoughts, I do what I want to do any way. I practice polyamory despite those thoughts -- not ignoring them, but acknowledging that they are there and acting anyway. Or I notice that I am obsessing about it and I go obsess about dolphins and blue whales instead. Or I say to myself, ""Wow, that was fucked up! Moving on now, lol.""  It takes practice to move on from obsessive thoughts. You need to create a habit that works against the habits of checking, ruminating, seeking false solutions. The brain is capable of observing itself. It sees obsessive thoughts and it says that they MUST be indicating a problem, that something MUST be wrong, because you are having obsessive thoughts! If you weren\'t having obsessive thoughts then everything would be fine! That\'s not true. When you have OCD, your brain generates unnecessary obsessive thoughts. Sometimes they are unnecessary and that\'s the end of it. They don\'t become more real when they\'re repeated.  Everyone is different, but for me I was able to move forward in life by accepting the presence of obsessive thoughts.   You don\'t want to change your name, so don\'t. Esra is your name now forever. Changing your name probably wouldn\'t end the thoughts, so don\'t make your life smaller to appease a disorder that doesn\'t care. Make sure to seek happiness and pleasure outside of obsessions as well. Thinking that nothing good is in your future is a terrible reason to shut out any happiness that you may experience.  You probably know that professional therapy or medication can help OCD. There is also self help for OCD if those aren\'t options for any reason. ERP (Exposure and response prevention) and CBT are common ones. Radical acceptance and distress tolerance are skills that you can specifically research that may help you.  If I sound short in any way, it\'s because I\'m avoiding the compulsions of making this comment better, more researched, more airtight, more appropriately placed. Perfect is the enemy of good.  Good luck Esra and nice to meet you."

Others need to respect the way you see your gender without using what cis society or even other trans people think to override that.  As for exactly why the term doesn't work for you, could it be related to the current view of nonbinary people as a third gender, like the idea that we all have a strong sense of a neutral gender identity? Or maybe because it references the binary and that isn't relevant to your identity?

Now would be a good time to clear up those things.  >but nothing much really changed besides pronouns\xe2\x80\xa6 Recently they started some transition process (looking at top surgery)  Stuff like coming out, changing pronouns, asking to be seen as a different gender is considered a transition too. Those things would be a social transition as opposed to a physical / medical transition, which would be things like top surgery or hormones, and it can still be an important, big change for many people.  An issue I and other nonbinary people sometimes run into is that someone may call us by the right words, but not have truly changed the context of how they see us, may still have gendered expectations that don't match our wishes for ourselves. Are you and your partner on the same page now about how they want their gender to be seen? With the new information you have about your partner, do you understand more about who they are as a person in any way?  Before my partner totally understood me, there would be some times when I'd do something gendered and it would seem like a switch flipped in my partner. They would change their behaviour almost like they reading off a script meant for someone of my assigned gender, it was really weird and incongruent, like it seemed obvious to me that I wouldn't want to be treated that way, even if what they were doing wasn't inherently bad. The same way it seems obvious to me that a person who recently realized they are nonbinary might want to look into physical transition options.  There are lots of gendered scripts we follow in life, especially if your relationship seemed like a straight one previously\xe2\x80\xa6 Are there any life scripts that you've been following that need to be reviewed?  >But also I need my own time to process and understand things.  You definitely do. Having a transitioning partner can be difficult and it's no one's fault. I hope you show yourself compassion and seek support for yourself during this change too. How long has it been?  Sometimes when a person comes out, they have been thinking about it for much longer than they let on. A lot of people can see signs of being nonbinary going back to early childhood and it can be difficult for us to tell how others see that time.  >My partner recently told me that they will be starting T in two weeks >I\xe2\x80\xa6 was honest with my feelings of being unsure.  Is there anything specific that you're unsure about? Is there something you found in your research that doesn't match your partner's transition goals?  You may also have a degree of internal uncertainty avoidance that you're dealing with. I had a similar discussion with another commenter the other day: ""We all need a feeling of security to live our lives, but sometimes, like you said, there is no way to tell the future. We don\'t need to let uncertainty ruin our lives at those times. Your relationship now and your experience together is valuable even if something comes along to change that. Believe what your partner says right now and give them the freedom to pursue happiness and truth for themselves if that ever changes, just like you\'d probably want for yourself.""  Sometimes uncertainty is good and there's real evidence and reasons to feel that way, and uncertainty can be a useful tool to make good decisions. Other times uncertainty gets in the way of making a decision. It helps me to put a limit on my uncertainty: \xe2\x80\x9cI'll spend another week thinking about it and creating a plan of action that I can be happy with. After that time is done I'll commit to the decision I made unless I get new information. I won't let uncertainty waste my time.\xe2\x80\x9d  >I think my partner was looking for me to be excited and jump for joy, but I can\'t be fake and do that. Should I?  I do think that in any relationship, there's an expectation that you will share moments of happiness together. You definitely shouldn't fake anything, but is there a reason you wouldn't be able to celebrate that your partner is getting something they're excited about, regardless of your own feelings?   I also have experiences where my partner would say they support me but not walk beside me emotionally, so to speak. It didn\'t feel good, it was a bit as if I had the rug pulled out from under me.  >I mean they are going to go through with it regardless of my own opinions, research, or feelings, so should I just not worry?  It is a bit difficult to feel like your partner isn't taking your perspective into account, I hope they are being a fair relationship partner, at the same time that it is true they are the only one with authority on their body and medical decisions.  >I may be lying to myself, I may just be scared that my partner will leave me when transitioned. Maybe I am scared that I will no longer be attracted to them as shallow as that sounds.  It would be a good idea to try to put your specific fears into words. You're not wrong just for feeling concerned that things may change. It's not inherently shallow to want to be attracted to your partner. I think most people would not want their partner to be in a body they don't like simply for the sake of your own attraction, however. Your wants and needs have to be in balance with those of your partners\' for you to have a successful relationship.  I think it would be fair to set up a time, separate from when you are being supportive of your partner, to discuss those concerns and ask your partner for help dealing with them, coming up with a plan together to face them. You are married, which is considered a life commitment by most people, and it would be normal to reaffirm that you both are still committed to the relationship and want to work to stay together after transition. If you both value your sexual life together, it would be normal to talk about how to make sure that's satisfying for the both of you. Remember that it's not you VS your partner, but you and your partner VS the problem."

One way you can cope with this is changing which part you see as the issue that needs to be fixed, especially if you and your partner haven\'t come to an agreement on that yet.  So for instance ""the frustration that comes with not being able to help..."" Are you making sure you\'re helping with what your partner wants help on? Maybe the ""help"" they want in that moment is someone to talk things over with and give feedback and emotional support. The same way you need to be validated in your perspective as a solutions person, your partner needs to be validated in their perspective and that the way they wish to handle things is right too. You may be doing this already, but remember that it\'s not you VS your partner, it\'s both of you together VS whatever would keep your relationship from being successful.  ""I usually want to focus on an issue for our conversations, can you help me figure out a helpful thing to focus on? Is the issue right now [wanting to feel heard / feeling that I don\'t respect your gender / fill in the blank]?""  >I am scared of not being attracted sexually to my partner, that is always on my mind. I'm worried eventually they will want to transition  Well, changing pronouns and being seen as a different gender IS a transition, so the thing you\'re afraid of is already partially happening, you don\'t have to keep worrying. I\'m assuming you meant a physical transition specifically, things like changing name or pronouns would be a social transition. I know many nonbinary people that don\'t want or need a physical transition, even people who are binary trans, so your partner is in no way an exception. Body parts are not inherently gendered, and neither are sexual roles or positions.  Your partner\'s transition doesn\'t necessarily mean that your sexual life will change, but growing with your partner and meeting them halfway, being honest about what you can and can\'t do, what you\'re willing and not willing to do, will go a long way. Neither of you are to blame for your sexual preferences and neither of your sexual preferences obligates the other to do something they\'re not happy about, but you can work together to figure out something that works for both of you.  > They assure me this will never be the case but how can one tell?   Besides planning for the future, sounds like there\'s also a degree of uncertainty avoidance involved. That\'s probably compounded when your partner can\'t share a concrete idea of their gender wishes.   We all need a feeling of security to live our lives, but sometimes, like you said, there is no way to tell the future. We don\'t need to let uncertainty ruin our lives at those times. Your relationship now and your experience together is valuable even if something comes along to change that. Believe what your partner says right now and give them the freedom to pursue happiness and truth for themselves if that ever changes, just like you\'d probably want for yourself.  ""I\'m still concerned about what the future holds, but I trust you and I want us to keep building our relationship to where we are both happy.""  >I also feel like they are asking for me to totally not mistake their pronouns in a very small time frame. ( 3 months or so) My partner sees this as me no putting effort in.   I wouldn\'t consider 3 months a small time frame... so I bet it doesn\'t feel that way to your partner. It\'s also possible they have been questioning their gender for   longer than those three months and it seems like longer to them.  You can be proactive about supporting your partner, you can practice their pronouns and preferred terms. People say stuff like ""[name] is my partner, I have been married to them for 10 years. They are non-binary. They use they/them pronouns. I am their husband. They are my spouse. It would be silly to call them my wife since that they aren\'t a woman. "" People are sometimes reluctant to say things like ""they are not a woman, they are not my wife"" because it\'s something that there is a bit of internal denial about. I wouldn\'t think it\'s weird to say a cis man is not a woman, so I think it\'s good to help normalize it and specifically create the association that these aren\'t the correct words.  Your reaction to messing up pronouns can be just as important as getting them right in the first place. If you\'re just saying that you need more time, it can come off like you think you\'ll automatically get it right once enough time has passed, and that isn\'t true. People need consistent exposure and practice to learn something, especially when it\'s replacing a habit with something new.  ""Sorry, I did a practice exercise with your pronouns earlier, but it didn\'t sink in yet. Your pronouns are they/them. I\'ll practice again later.""  Plus all the above... I also struggle with impatience in these kinds of situations. It is hard to deal with when you\'re in an uncomfortable situation and you can\'t do  anything about it, including when you have to wait for someone else to do something. Sometimes time is indeed a part of the process to improve a situation, but that doesn\'t necessarily mean it\'s idle time. Time might mean getting practice responding in a new way, getting restful sleep so the brain can process new information, it might mean that you need basic matters to be settled before you can work on more advanced things, it might mean watchful waiting, where you are taking in details but not acting yet. You can change your perspective to value those little things and redirect your energy to what you can actionably do. You can also use the skill of ""sitting with your feelings"" if the frustration or other uncomfortable feelings are hard to take.  I\'m sure I could say more but I wonder if this is enough to go on. Good luck and feel free to tell me if I was mistaken or said something that did not apply."

You care about what the stranger said for the same reason that you care about the support you were getting at pride.  This just happened to be one of the times when that instinct, which is normally for self-preservation, is working against you -- this dude said things to you that go against your values and hurt you. You don\'t need to reject that whole instinct, you can just reject that guy and his ideas.  I find that affirmatively rejecting people like that works better for me than, for instance, ignoring that it happened or pushing away the memory. ""I\'m glad I know myself better than that guy and I can accept myself. This experience can strengthen my resolve and my sureness in expressing myself how I see fit."" VS ""I\'ll try not to think about that, it doesn\'t matter what he said.""  >Why after that whole fun night of being proud, do I feel more insecure and dissociated from my self then I did before?  You took a risk by going out dressed that way at pride, and something bad happened to you. It\'s hard not to see this negative experience as evidence more of the same is in your future, especially if it\'s the first time you dressed that way and you don\'t have so many more experiences to compare.

While neither of my two relationships are explicitly romantic, they\'re both long term committed life partnerships that function like romantic relationships do for other people.

The reality of my body has nothing to do with either the word male or female. My body exists regardless of whether those words are used. In fact, people who do not speak English don't use these words and never need these words. I'm not denying what my chromosomes are, what reproductive organs I have, or what my dominant hormone is. I'm denying you the right to package that and refer to it with a gendered word.  >it's wrong for society to pressure them into feeling their body is wrong  Actually, you're pressuring me into feeling my body is wrong.

That\'s what I\'m trying to get across to you. Your personal belief and opinion about what these words mean doesn\'t change what they practically convey to other people.  I don\'t understand having a belief that a word means something besides what dictionaries, governments, English speakers in general, and you and I understand them to mean. What makes a word have a meaning to you, besides the meaning that you intuitively understand from it? Since you can decide that male and female only mean sex and not gender, what stops me from deciding the opposite, that all four only mean gender, and we don\'t need a word for sex? Who\'s got the authority to decide that that collection of sounds and letters in that order means anything?  >It's uncommon to hear someone refer to a group of woman as \xe2\x80\x9cfemales,\xe2\x80\x9d for example, and when it does happen it tends to be off-putting.   You gave evidence of a collection of people who use female to mean woman and they are understood by the general population, well enough to critique the usage. Just because it is off putting to you doesn\'t mean that you don\'t understand the meaning. It isn\'t like they called the group ""pokies"" and that\'s the first time you saw that and you have no reference for what that means. You intuited that they were referring to a group of people all of the same gender which was woman. To me, that\'s what shows that ""female"" does mean woman, and that makes it inappropriate to use those words to refer to somehow whose gender does not match.  When people are assigned ""male"" or ""female"" at birth, the intention is very much that that is our sex AND our gender. That is why when someone comes out as binary trans they may choose to change their document marker to show the other choice. Would you tell them that they\'re not really ""female"" or ""male"" unless they get a medical procedure? When someone\'s legal gender is recorded that way, why can\'t they also refer to it that way? To say that they\'re not actually male or female, just a man or woman, comes off as denying the reality of the world. More precise language is needed to avoid that implication and what could be experienced as misgendering for many people. That\'s what I said in my original comment.  >it's not appropriate to be referring to people as being male or female in casual conversation anyway,  It feels like a dirty secret. Like everyone knows I\'m really ""male"" or ""female"" but they\'ll just whisper about it, like it\'s humoring me to respect my identity, or the identity of others who use male or female as their gender. We still can\'t change our chromosomes, which to many people are the main determiner of sex, a concept that humans made up. No matter what procedure I could get there will always be people who say I\'m really my assigned sex / gender based on that. It doesn\'t feel any different when another trans person is saying it."

If I did, it would have terrible implications for the validity of all identities and who has the authority to decide.  Additionally, the processes of identity are subjective and largely subconscious and not everybody experiences it the same way. People post all the time saying that they don\'t understand what identification or gender really is. Maybe what that person experiences as a philosophy would be understood as an identity by someone else. The nonbinary community is diverse and it takes all sorts.  This topic gets a lot of backlash here because it\'s a viewpoint that is used to oppress us sometimes, saying that nonbinary people only have a different ideology, and that our experiences of identification and self-evaluation are not real.

You saying my sex is male / female is also calling me a man / woman because that\'s what those words mean, and I am not a man or woman. Neither you nor I have the natural authority or practical ability to control how words are used -- when you say you are right and that it\'s objectively true that non-intersex people are ""male"" or ""female,"" and must physically transition if they don\'t want to be, that sounds exactly like saying gender and sex are connected, because those words mean genders as well as sexes.  >I think those definitions are outdated.  The dictionaries I referenced are all descriptive dictionaries. They are not guides to how words are supposed to be used or the right or wrong way to use them, they only describe how the words are actuallly used by real speakers of English. As long as people use the words this way, it will be defined that way. That\'s how words get their meaning, not from someone claiming authority to dictate the meaning from on high. You and other redditors understood what the original commenter meant when they used ""male"" in that way, even if you didn\'t agree with how it was used. It\'s clear that in the present day, male and female can be said and understood to refer to the binary genders man and woman.  ""Male"" and ""female"" do not have to be the words we use to distinguish the sexes, the 2 general packages of sex traits that occur in humans. There is no reason why we have to continue using the words in instances when they are so deeply intertwined with gender, causing harm and confusion.  I\'m also genuinely surprised that you don\'t consider sex more complicated than that, since you are a trans person with a background in biology. What you\'re saying seems outdated to me. What exactly are you referring to when you say male or female? Someone\'s chromosomes, an immutable characteristic? The cell that someone contributes in reproduction, which has implications for those who are infertile? Someone\'s genitals or dominant hormone, in which case why not simply name the specific thing rather than saying male or female? The idea that these traits, all of which can be construed as making up someone\'s sex, can be packaged neatly together or are even determined for sure in every single person, seems old and not up to date with the current science. Any of us who hasn\'t had specific testing could be found to not have the full package of ""male"" or ""female"" traits. It\'s possible to find out you are intersex way, way late in life, and sex is legally determined in many jurisdictions by only a glance at genitals, when there are many other equally relevant sex characteristics. What counts as intersex is not objectively defined, it\'s a standard set by humans with cissexist prejudices, and that standard is constantly evolving. Why should I be called a gendered term that purports to refer to my sex, when that term is as best an assumption that was made about me decades ago, and that\'s the case for many, many people? If you mean something specific you can always name that trait specifically.  >I very firmly believe it's best not to intertwine the concepts of gender and sex  I\'m not the one intertwining them, I was born into a society of humans who intertwine them. I firmly believe it\'s best not to deny that these words are used to misgender and harm trans people even when they\'re referring to ""sex,"" and to claim authority to redefine them for the entire English-speaking population is only enabling that harm."

I say this as a nonbinary who has a degree in linguistics. It simply is not true that these words are completely separate from each other and never mean the same thing. Just because there are two separate concepts doesn\'t change the fact that the concepts overlap in these pairs of words.  Nobody has a natural authority to control how words are used, including you or I, but by looking at various instances of these words we can see that English speakers do not use the words this way. Merriam-Webster, Cambridge, and Macmillan dictionaries all use the words male and man circularly to define each other. A male is generally defined as a man and a man is generally defined as a male, among other uses. There are explicit references to male being a gender identity. If you look at Wikipedia, you can see the same thing... a man is described as a male and the page for male even has the sentence, ""In humans, the word male can also be used to refer to gender.""   It may not be easy or clean or convenient, but English speakers know that these words mean each other. There is no line being blurred, there\'s a line that people are trying to put up, unsuccessfully, because historically both these words have been used to describe the same thing and it\'s extremely difficult to purposely change a language all at once in all of its speakers. There is always an implication of the other concept. When someone on the street misgenders me it\'s because they have guessed at my genitals, when a doctor sees my biological sex they no longer have doubt about what gender I am, because to them it\'s the same thing. That\'s why I would never allow someone to call me male or female, because I am neither of those -- for someone to insist that I really am one of those genders/sexes would be oppressive, would be purposeful misgendering in the barest sense, using a gendered word to describe someone it does not apply to."

Is there any way you can reconceptualize crying, is it inherently feminine / non manly, or can it be masculine to be secure in your gender while crying? Can you train yourself to cry in a different manner, can you do a ""manly cry"" or ""single man tear""? Can you change how you look at your emotions, would seeing emotions as secondary to ""what needs to be done"" help you focus on action in the moment?

My bad, didn\'t intend to disrespect the knowledge you came in with. So what I\'m getting now is that you\'re kind of questioning the usefulness as nonbinary as a label and concept. What I was trying to get across was that it can be literally anything you want, there isn\'t any one understanding of its point in the world, because gender is just a bunch of people saying things.  >The weird to me is it seems I\'m forced to have a gender identity.  So in line with the above, I didn\'t get who it is that\'s forcing you -- it\'s people in society? Or it\'s your current understanding of gender or yourself, for instance?  Maybe there\'s also some discommunication between us about what is an identity? An identity isn\'t just something that you are or say you are, it\'s something that you feel you are, it\'s a brain process that affects how you perceive the world and your relation to it and others. Explaining yourself to others as nonbinary isn\'t the same as identifying as nonbinary, the two just usually with each other. For example -- I\'m pacific islander and I grew up having people tell means that means I\'m asian. But my family doesn\'t call themselves asian and I don\'t see myself as asian. As an adult, I recognize that when others say ""asian"" that probably means people like me, but I don\'t feel anything about that word and I don\'t feel any connection to other ""asians"" for instance. It\'s kind of a controversial viewpoint since so many people have had to fight so hard for the reality of their identities to be recognized, and because identity is such a subconscious process, but I think this could be useful to you.  A lot of agender people also use this label because they don\'t have a relevant gender identity.  >The other thing for me is that if we get rid of all gender roles and expectations (which to me seems like something to aim for), what meaning could any gender hold?  Well, there wouldn\'t be a point, but that won\'t happen within our lifetimes for sure, so why worry about it? Creating social groups and forming identities is just a basic ability of the human species that\'s not going to leave very soon. It\'s just us vs them, a survival tactic letting us selectively share our resources with others to survive.  So this is like a meaning of life thing. Is every one of your identities / personal labels something that\'s been forced on you, not chosen or used as a tool by you? Maybe you can come to an answer by looking at your other identities: age group, member of your race, personality, hobbies and skills, stuff like that.  >Maybe I\'m just faling to perceive how some people might find value in identifying with certain labels. But to me that just seems like imposing unnecessary restrictions on yourself.  Adult vs child is an identity / role that people normally feel very strongly about. Does existing in society under the label ""adult"" impose restrictions on me? Like, I guess I can\'t make friends with children or pay kids\' price entrance fees, but...  Got to go for now, let me know if any of this is meaningful to you. :)"

eRisk2023-T3_Subject17, b' ' , b'2022-04-09 01:46:32' , reddit post ,"So gender is a social construct, and that means that, opposed to stuff like math and laws of physics, it can\'t be measured completely objectively, it isn\'t rigid, it\'s contextual and inherently changeable. Gender is literally made of a bunch of people saying stuff to each other, at the same time, all over the world, constantly. So I see developing a gender identity (developing any identity) as figuring out the right things to say, do, etc, to communicate your experience to others, and to survive.  That\'s why many people (including me) don\'t see anything wrong with positively identifying yourself as nonbinary when you don\'t have any strong attachments to any labels. Being oppressed isn\'t a game, so to speak -- there\'s no playing unfair. Nobody deserves to be under the control of another, you don\'t need to accept oppression for others\' sake if being nonbinary would help free you. If you say you\'re nonbinary and need freedom from gender roles, it actually adds to everyone else\'s voice saying that the gender roles were fucked up in the first place.  >So in that regard I don\'t see why ""just me"" (and other enbys) would get to bypass those expectations/roles.  We don\'t, though. Just because I say I\'m nonbinary doesn\'t mean we don\'t face binary gender roles all the time; just because someone is a binary gender doesn\'t mean they don\'t experience freedom to act outside their gender role. It isn\'t as black and white as that, we have to look at what individuals are experiencing, at the same time that we consider societal messages.  >that doesn\'t mean other people identify with 100% of the characteristics ascribed to gender.  You\'re right, for a lot of people their gender is a ""best fit,"" just like nonbinary might be for you :)  >I want gender liberation for myself, which could take the form of identifying as nonbinary, but I want it for everyone  Advocating for gender freedom in society is a separate (but related) concept to having your own personal identity that describes and expresses you. You don\'t have to have any specific identity to advocate, and vice versa. If you can, find a way to do both !  [Comment no longer under construction, sorry for delay lol]"

Saying ""this gene is usually associated with maternal inheritance"" leaves more room for a birthing parent who doesn\'t identify as a mother than just outright saying ""this was passed down maternally."" Sometimes that\'s the best you can do without having a crash course on gender for every single person you talk to. If I had this experience, I wouldn\'t feel particularly included, but it also wouldn\'t be the worst thing in the world, since any interaction with the medical field involves these kind of oversights.  I\'d probably want to be referred to by name if I had genetic testing for my child. ""This gene was passed down through [name]"" ""this came from [name]\'s side of the family"" or to be told exactly why there\'s a connection to physical sex, ""this gene was passed down on the Y chromosome,"" etc. (Without knowing more about genetic testing, it\'s hard to suggest alternatives.)

Common is just common. I\'ve got a feeling that those who use this kind of language are specifically responding to the idea that humans are inherently gendered. It\'s a way of reclaiming the idea that you can\'t be human without a gender. Also remember that the nonbinary community skews pretty young and some of the speech you are seeing is from teens who may not be seeing adult society the way we do   I\'m in between personally, while I definitely enjoy being seen as an entity or non-human in a way, I do think it occasionally goes so far as to be dissociative, and I shy away from the idea that internal experiences are spiritually significant, or as ""real,"" so to speak, as the physical world.  But if you (in the general sense) give others permissions to experience gender the way they do without judgement, you\'ll also be giving yourself permission   We\'re all here in this community together with our individual views, you don\'t need to think like the others here to be welcome.

I worked retail, and the biggest problem I have is the labeling of the different cuts as 2 binary genders. I (like many people) shop majorily in one of the two gendered sections, because the clothes from the other section are normally not made for my body. That doesn\'t make it a women\'s or men\'s cut or anything dumb like that. My cisgender male partner also fits well into ""women\'s"" clothes because he\'s particularly short and prefers tighter clothes. It\'s pointless for stores to try to hide or prevent him from buying those clothes.  Overall it\'s a lack of oversight and true allyship for them to push this shirt in two binary-gendered styles. If it\'s between the two options, having the one unisex cut would be preferable, because it shows attention paid to the situation and an actual effort to disrupt the status quo.  It also benefits stores to obscure what they actually mean when they label clothes because it promotes consumer\'s dependence on the store and belief that your body is wrong, not the clothes, so you keep buying even when the clothes they produce are total shit  "

Even though it\'s really terrible that he hasn\'t made an effort to understand your feelings and do something less hurtful, I want to say that just because he has opinions does not mean they have any power or affect your validity at all. He\'s just wrong, and that\'s that.   At times when my partner had a hurtful opinion or view of me that they wouldn\'t budge on, it helped me personally to say / think stuff like, ""I understand that\'s your opinion, but you are not the only one whose opinion matters. To me, [this is a queer relationship.] Our balance of thoughts and actions is what creates this relationship, and not just one side. I want to give you the freedom to have the beliefs you think are right for you, but I won\'t believe or agree with something that is harmful to me or to our relationship. Just because you say [it\'s a straight relationship] does not make it true.""  It helped me also to not only explain why the other person\'s thoughts were harmful, but to talk about a new system to replace the previous one they had in their head and why the new system is helpful. ""When I\'m not trapped by the expectations of straightness, I can be my authentic self and give you everything I have to offer as a relationship partner."" ""When I see that you are willing to be flexible on your relationship ideas, I\'ll know I can trust you to do what\'s right for us and I\'ll be able to commit myself more fully to our relationship."" Etc  Also, straight is not a very well defined term, different people may be using it to mean a relationship that\'s not gay, a relationship between a man and woman, or a relationship between people of different genders -- the latter of which you could technically be. It\'s possible the two of you have different understandings of the word. It sounds like he doesn\'t have a very expansive view of gender roles, so he\'s saying that the relationship isn\'t gay as in between 2 men, which to you comes off as saying the relationship is between a man and woman, with you as the woman. It could help to illuminate those different meanings and to talk using clearer words than just ""straight."""

Jan 6 insurrectionists already said they were defending themselves when they performed the original riot -- we saw what they meant when they used this phrasing. They cried wolf. I don't personally  feel responsible for not believing they're arguing in good faith anymore.  The top comment could just as likely be referring to him facing legal repercussions for committing more unprovoked violence that he Thinks was provoked. And while the bottom (or either) comment certainly is poking fun at the possibility that he could encounter violence, there's a difference between expressing an emotion and putting it into practice. Vengefully relishing a specific situation where no violence has even occurred, which most of us have no power to interfere in, does not mean we do not advocate for safety for prisoners in general."

Can it be both that you\'re comfortable with a progressive masculinity as a man AND that this makes you nonbinary? It doesn\'t have to be either / or. Gender being a social construct means that it\'s formed through relations and interactions with others, it\'s a generalization, an amalgamation of every experience you\'ve ever had. When every person you meet has a different understanding of gender, it\'s difficult to form a clear image of yourself. I think it helps to refuse the urge to simplify.  Remember, also, that nonbinary doesn\'t mean a non-man non-woman. If you felt, for instance, that you\'re 99% man and 1% something else, if that 1% was important to you, I would gladly welcome you as a fellow nonbinary person. People use the label for different purposes and to mean different things, just like people have different concepts of manhood and womanhood.  >While I can appreciate that many men are attractive, and would be perfectly happy being in a long-term partnership with another man, I have never once in my life been physically or sexually attracted to a man.  What if I said there\'s many people who would consider that a valid way to be bisexual? (At the very least, biromantic.) Sexuality and attraction has a lot of different schools of thought too. I think it only seems simpler than gender to most people because it\'s been discussed in the mainstream for much longer and has been boiled down to very clear societal messages, while nuance-adding factors like aromanticism haven\'t entered the mainstream yet.   >If, instead, gender identity is determined by occasional or persistent discomfort with assigned biology, while gender expression is simply the extent to which a person subscribes to traditional gender roles, then I am definitely cisgender.  It\'s controversial in the community. People who believe dysphoria over physical characteristics is what defines transness are called transmedicalists, transmeds, truscum (derogatory).  >I don\'t know what to think about those two definitions (if you can call them that).  A third option to consider: gender identity is based on the processes of group recognition, the same ones we use to decide to call ourselves humans, adults, or members of our racial group for example. Gender isn\'t bound by rules, but an internal experience of being in a group of people like you. If you look at nonbinary people and think, ""I\'m like them... I\'m one of those people,"" I\'d consider you nonbinary. Or conversely, if you experience a sensation of not being like cis men or cis women with regard to gender, and find the term nonbinary useful... that\'s a very real and valid nonbinary experience as well.  >I honestly don\'t know if it\'s because that\'s truly how I identify or if, as someone who is extremely online, I find the prospect of no longer being a cishet white man, the most oppressive of groups, and instead being able to ""win points"" by identifying as a marginalized identity and thus be welcome in spaces dedicated to those groups, enticing.   What if I said you can\'t lose privilege just by identifying as nonbinary? Privilege isn\'t something you have inherently by virtue of simply being something. It\'s a social position gained by your experiences, how others in society treat you. Privilege isn\'t generated, so to speak; it\'s conferred to you by somebody else. If people give you privilege now, and are still giving you privilege after you start seeing yourself differently, you haven\'t won any points. If you wear feminine clothes and people remove that privilege... it isn\'t because you identified as nonbinary. It\'s because you wore feminine clothes. It\'s a problem for people to discriminate against any person who wear feminine clothes, regardless of whether they identify as nonbinary.  Approach privilege in a way that acknowledges that simply having privilege is morally neutral, and that the system that assigns privilege according to gender, race, and other discriminatory factors is the real problem, and you won\'t have a problem with this. Look at the privilege you have objectively and with the aim to dismantle the systems that unfairly assign it to you (or don\'t assign it you). And obviously you shouldn\'t purposely wield your identity to gain an upper hand, but I think that hypothetical is often overvalued by questioning people.  -  I\'m running out of steam here, but the last thing I want to say is, for every person who will say that you are nonbinary, there\'s another person who will say you aren\'t. You have the right to develop your own understanding of the term and to express and enjoy that in a group of like-minded people if that\'s what you so wish. It\'s an extremely diverse community. But yes, plenty of people including myself would say that you\'re nonbinary, based on what you said and because you want to be."

The experience is awarded at the moment the notification pops up, not at the moment you actually reach best friends with them.

For example, with the questions about asexuality being a choice or being caused by trauma, it seems that the ""correct"" answer would be to disagree, however there\'s a huge movement right now of people who do believe that their orientation was affected by their trauma, or believe there was an element of choice. To accept those people we can\'t take a hard stance that orientation is definitively Not affected by experiences or choices...  The same with questions about being single. Maybe someone IS single because they\'re unattractive, or eccentric, or hard to get along with -- you won\'t get a strong disagree from me, because the reasons why someone is single don\'t matter, and they don\'t affect that person\'s goodness or worthiness as a human. I hope that isn\'t how my responses will be interpreted.  It\'s also interesting that you didn\'t ask about participants\' romantic orientation.

That\'s where I would start, by thinking about or even making a list of things that\'s either personally necessary for a good Thanksgiving, or not necessary but preferable.  Then if you know what symptoms you might be having that day, you can make a plan of coping strategies you can use ahead of time, or what activities you\'ll be doing instead if you think you can\'t continue.   Specifically, I tend to get overstimulated in places with a lot of people, so it really helps to have a spot you can go to be by yourself or with a trusted person, away from noise to collect yourself (I would consider this kind of mandatory). I have heard of people also having like a Holiday buddy, a specific person they can count on that knows about their issues, to do things like check in on them at specific times or make excuses to family when you need a break.

But that's a me problem, it's never the fault of the person who is only exploring their identity as anyone does.  Most people question their identity in this situation because that's the normal thing to do when you encounter a new social situation to navigate, and new information to navigate it with. Maybe you never seriously considered a different gender identity because there wasn't space or time to. Now that you have a date mate who's raised the topic, who's open to or even welcoming of you not being cisgender, it makes tons of sense to explore new possibilities. Don't let preemptions of your friends' judgements ruin that for you.  >I've never met or heard of anyone who just dropped their gender because other members' behavior made them uncomfortable. Like I feel like just finding some mens' behavior off-putting is a flimsy excuse.  I find that most gendered behaviours by other people make me uncomfortable. It's not really that far out that someone connecting such an evil act with an identity that you hold would cause you to question it. As you continue to understand yourself, you can figure out if you totally agree with that assertion and whether your identity even has anything to do with that at all. You don't really need an excuse to explore your identity, if something caused you to think about gender differently, it just did, that's neither good nor bad.  All in all, totally normal and valid reaction. Gender is an inherently social experience, one that I think necessarily takes time and interactions with others to figure out.

Good survey, I\'m so happy to see someone looking into multisexuality as a whole, without prioritizing one label or the other :) I love this community and organizing with ppl like me under the multisexual label gives me pure queer joy.  Just a couple notes --  On the question about split attraction, that asks whether your romantic orientation is different from your sexual orientation, while it\'s true for me as an aromantic pansexual that I\'m attracted to ""different"" groups of people romantically and sexually, I personally consider my attraction a package deal. When someone attracts my sexual attention they also attract my lack of romantic attention, to put it another way, these two orientations don\'t conflict at all for me. The broader term is a non-SAM aro or non-SAM ace, the SAM being split attraction model  As a nonbinary person as well, the question about whether your relationship is hetero-presenting or homo-presenting was hard to navigate, I wasn\'t sure how I should answer. I wonder if this question could be better served by ""I\'m a woman in a relationship with a man"" ""I\'m a woman in a relationship with a woman"" and so on, depending on the information you\'re trying to get? For nbs and for many binary trans ppl, how our gender is understood by others can vary widely (and I\'ve also heard from some people that they feel these labels require them to misgender themselves). And while I\'m sure my relationships are understood either as straight or as gay depending on the circumstances, a lot of the time we\'re also seen as cousins, siblings, or friends because of the aromanticity    Anyway, thank you and good luck with your survey!"

For example when you said, ""Doesn\'t ANY use of binary \'he/him\' or \'she/her\' pronouns completely defeat the very definition of being nonbinary?"" It could be understood as a rhetorical question, simply intending to tell us the last part of the sentence. Another of your questions, ""does it make sense to still identify as nonbinary?"" could be understood as telling this group that they shouldn\'t identify as nonbinary, thus the gatekeeping. Some alternative ways to ask these might be like, ""Could you explain how he/him or she/her don\'t contradict with being nonbinary?"" ""How do he/him or she/her fit into your identity?"" etc.  I\'ve seen other people ask about this situation but plenty of them manage to ask without bringing the validity of anyone\'s identity into question, or using phrasing that\'s reminiscent of transphobia.  It\'s very difficult to see you quote a dictionary to defend your words -- I have had people quote dictionaries to me about sex and gender to tell me that being nonbinary isn\'t real.

It\'s really difficult to explain something as nebulous and socially contructed and subconsciously experienced as gender in a way that other people understand and can identify with, and it\'s totally normal to make a decision about a term based on your own interpretation of it. There are plenty of microlabels that are defined solely by a single page or paragraph by the person who created it.  The only one of these terms I have seen before is lunarian, and my understanding of it is that it\'s more of an alignment than a gender. As someone who doesn\'t personally use alignment terminology my best description of it would be like a way to say you\'re ""one of them,"" like if the gym teacher separated students by gender, you\'d go to the side with the girls, even though you may not be a girl yourself.

No science is a monolith -- it\'s all research done by specific individual researchers or groups of researchers, and as widespread as binary bias is, those researchers are almost guaranteed to have the same ideas about the binary as you\'ll encounter in everyday life.

We're all different people with different ideas.  Everyone gets to make their own boundaries about who can misgender them, who can date them, etc as an individual, so maybe that's the disconnect you're getting with other trans people -- I've seen discussions like this go down and often a person with your viewpoint is (mis?)understood as telling others that it's ok for them to be misgendered or that their need for gender validation by their relationship partners is wrong.

While a lot of the questions were thoughtfully worded, it was difficult to navigate how to answer those that packed multiple statements into one. Such as the statement, ""My height doesn\'t reflect my gender."" There\'s not really a way to say I believe height empirically cannot reflect gender without implying that I think my personal height is incongruent with my personal gender.  I view gender expression as something purposeful people do, and since I can\'t and didn\'t choose to have a specific body, my body doesn\'t express my gender at all. I also believe (like many others) gender is a social construct, and therefore something we people think is associated with body rather than something that actually is naturally associated with bodies. While dysphoria is a real and pervasive issue that needs attention, I feel this is a perspective that\'s often overlooked, especially with the medicalization of transness as people who have the medical condition of gender dysphoria, and the oversimplifications of transness as ""born in the wrong body."" The culture changing to allow any person with any body to self-identify as any gender has gone a long way in reducing dysphoria for me and many people I know.  Just some thoughts as I have seen you be receptive to feedback on other posts.  A nitpick -- the relationship question does not allow you to state that you are in a committed relationship that\'s also polyamourous. Then one of the questions asks how satisfied you would be committing to a single person, and I fear my answer is being used to imply my dysphoria negatively affects my ability to have a relationship rather than that I prefer to keep the multiple commitments I have now."

What I'm saying is *we should not interpret this as meaning that they necessarily cared about that woman's pleasure.* As demonstrated, it could be the kind of narcissistic, self focused enjoyment that I talked about, which falls in line with the idea that they rated higher on narcissism. The study has too many issues to conclude anything from it, and this characterization of men who commit anywhere from rape to sexual harassment as well meaning, simply confused men has consequences."

You\'re right. I don\'t understand. Either I and most of the men I know were not raised in the culture you are referring to, you wrong about this, or you are using the phrase ""a woman\'s pleasure as it relates to the woman herself"" in a way I don\'t understand.  I\'m going to be totally blunt here. If a man rapes a woman, and she orgasms, do you think he enjoys that? Do you think he might feel some pleasure, even *masculine* pleasure, about what he\'s capable of doing to a woman sexually? Do you see how that relates to men being taught that sex partners are conquests, that their partner orgasming makes them real, skillful men?  Enjoying someone\'s pleasure doesn\'t mean you necessarily care about it for reasons of fairness and equality. Maybe you just personally enjoy it. It doesn\'t mean that you\'ll fight for it when it\'s deserved. The same way that liking or loving individual women doesn\'t mean you won\'t hold deeply sexist and prejudiced beliefs about them.  >The closest I can find is someone pointing out that this study indicates that many men might not understand that they are violating a boundary...

This relates to the sexual objectification of women and how their sexual pleasure is purposed, traditionally and in the mainstream, for men's enjoyment. This is so strong that we literally have people today not aware that people with vaginas can have an orgasm. It's not a coincidence. And why do the women in porn pretend to like what they're doing, and do you think they actually do? Why do we have such a widespread phenomenon of women and other people with vaginas faking an orgasm for their partner? Because that portrayal of female sexual pleasure is *for men* and not actually attuned to what that woman wants or is experiencing. A man who is raised in that culture doesn't inherently care about a woman's pleasure as it relates to the woman herself, and assuming he does only gets in the way of no matter who you are talking to, no matter what the reason, sending an unsolicited dick pic is assault."

What I usually say is to seek out things that make them feel euphoric or good/right with their own gender. I think a lot of people get trapped by the fact that there's no positive, happy representation of trans people available, and for a lot of people the only trans life they can imagine is one of suffering, so I try to go against that. Is there some way they can dress, some way they can act during sex, some way they can carry themselves or be treated by you that would help them feel more at home with themselves?  You might need to appeal to their specific gender that they are, nonbinary is a pretty broad term and many people have a gender experience more succinctly described by another term or description. For example I also identify as neutrois or neutral gendered. What helps me most is applying that neutral gender to all aspects of me, so all parts of my body, my mind, whatever, is neutral. If I wear clothes from the men's department, that's neutral and I'm neutral. Whether I have long hair or short hair, that's neutral. It doesn't matter what biological process I have because that's also neutral, there is no contradiction between my body and my gender. Are there ways that you two can talk about their experiences that put them more in line with the gender that they are? (Or they also may not want to talk about it, which is fine.)   Since they're feeling isolated, maybe the two of you could get involved in nb/trans spaces together, like joining a forum, a subreddit (!), or some kind of community. Like, enabling them to find friendships with people who might share their experiences (and even if no one shares their experience, knowing that they're still valid because we're all on our path as individuals). I see a lot of people in the sub who introduce themselves and it's the very first time they've told anyone they are nonbinary, it might help for your partner to have that experience with a wider range of people.  Something I'd be happy if my partner did, since I'm scientifically minded, is if they got interested in gender science, I'd like if every once in a while they talked to me about some scholarly article or something they read in the news about transness. That would show me I'm not the only one who cares about that sort of thing or who cares about my experiences, as well as connecting me to the greater population of trans/nb people.

No, that\'s definitely not what I want. If there\'s a part that can be cleared up please say so, it\'s very difficult to say what I want to say when more precise words don\'t exist.  Male and female are used today to mean sex and gender together. Sometimes the sex meaning is more relevant, sometimes the gender meaning is more relevant, but outside of trans discourse, society doesn\'t recognize these as separate meanings because they don\'t realize there can be a separation in the first place.  More personally, I do see my sex as nonbinary because I don\'t identify with the sex and gender package expressed by either of those words. I\'m happy to identify the relevant parts of my sex when needed, but it\'s not as relevant as people think.  >those who have transitioned... adopt the congruent gender and sex labels because they\'re aligned  The issue I have is the idea that there objectively *is* a congruence. That\'s socially imposed, not inherent. As more people become familiar with the concept of sex and gender being separate, we have more and more trans people who are no transition / never transition, and they are equally valid with the ones who do need a transition. My genitals and sex characteristics have literally nothing to do with my gender at all, they are completely and totally separate. I shouldn\'t have to undergo surgery or change my body to be recognized as my true gender, that\'s like telling me I have to cut off my hand to be recognized as an adult and not a child.  >they feel that their identities are congruent after transitioning and thus they are no longer ""trans"".  I see the community moving away from this understanding of transness. Nowadays I see trans being defined as having your true identity differ from the sex and gender you were assigned at birth, which is something that stays with you through transition. I really feel that the concept of transness you described is based on suffering being intertwined with transness, which is too long of an issue for me to get into here but it\'s harmful to say the least.  >...the most helpful and respectful way to handle the data without allowing it to become unwieldy...  Most people don\'t know for sure that all the aspects of their sex align with male or female, they can only assume based on their birth assignment and experiences. We can avoid reifying the sex/gender binary by asking the exact thing we mean, in this case birth assignment, which is based on genitals at birth, by which we assume all the other sex characteristics of a person. Then whether they are intersex, have undergone physical transition, or whatever else is relevant like ovary removal and so on.  But for most things, imho, sex just isn\'t as relevant as people think it is (compared to gender), and researchers who want to investigate physical sex without acknowledging the different aspects of sex and the many assumptions and correlations with sex are running the risk of having shoddy data, all in the name of convenience."

eRisk2023-T3_Subject17, b' ' , b'2019-07-24 07:18:24' , reddit post ,"I\'m nonbinary and I don\'t agree with using male/female only to mean sex. These are gendered words, used as genders in society. They are the words that are used to assign gender at birth. They\'ve been inextricably intertwined with gender since probably the terms even existed, the idea of gender even being separate from sex only got popular in the 50\'s.   It only causes me dysphoria and pain to hear from apparent allies that male/female is just a sex [read: ""you *really are* male/female!""], ignoring the decades of experience I and other trans people have had, and every cis person also, having these words mean sex and gender together at the same time. One of the big things trans people face is this idea their sex is somehow incongruent with their body, that for example their gender may be female (said ""woman"") but their body is ""male,"" and that\'s total bullshit, because there\'s nothing at all discrepant about a woman with a penis/testosterone-based body/XY chromosomes etc. Not to mention that many people, cis and trans alike, identify with male or female as their gender. We\'re not going to get anywhere redefining those words to take that gender experience from them. People can *feel* maleness, femaleness just as deeply in their gender as they feel like a man or woman.  Upholding the binary understanding of sex also doesn\'t serve intersex people or trans people who physically transition, it treats us/them as outliers and literally others us, because the sex choices acceptable in society are often male, female, and *other*. It doesn\'t help cis people to rework their understanding of sex (and thus gender), because the concept of gender identity separate from sex isn\'t fully entrenched in society yet.   I see the usefulness of the shorthand for describing sex traits that generally go together, but we don\'t have a gender neutral term yet. What we have now is saying what we mean when we mean it. If you want to talk about what genitals someone has, say that. If you want to say what their chromosomes are, say that. If you want to say if they menstruate, produce sperm, what their dominant hormone is, say that. Because otherwise we\'re just perpetuating a binary view of sex and gender out of laziness"

It's *always* about PIV. What happens in women's spaces is a person doesn't enjoy PIV, so we change the discussion to center different types of sex and different ways to be sexual.  But what I see even here is that if someone with a penis can't orgasm from PIV, the discussion never shifts in that way. We pin the problems on porn, we talk about abstaining from other sex to better perform PIV, we lessen the focus on orgasm but never suggest that PIV shouldn't be the main course. I think we should talk more about PIV not being the ideal it's upheld as, it's literally just how we developed to make babies. Once we get past that focus we can start having fuller and more inclusice sexual lives."

It seems like you\'re just arguing the status quo.  I\'m not talking about emotional ""outlets,"" I\'m talking about men celebrating and being open to the wide *range* of emotions they experience, rather than pushing them down as a coping mechanism. To be totally clear: I am not talking about expressing emotions at all, in any way. I am talking about feeling them and men being encouraged to feel and have vibrant internal emotional lives, and that being celebrated. Expression is another issue. Also, loving *things* and being overly focused on creature comforts is a trait of people who have learned to avoid emotional intimacy.  I\'m not faulting this kind of emotional expression for its depth. I\'m faulting it for its shallowness, its limitedness, for its focus in the mainstream on this one experience as the epitome of men\'s love.  I don\'t agree that that kind of song is indicative of a person who has a full and vibrant emotional life, most of them sound like deeply stunted people who are suffering. Suffering shouldn\'t be centered for any kind of celebration of any identity, and for men specifically it falls into this cultural puzzle that contributes to suicide.

Women are the only thing men are allowed to love, and that\'s *why* we have so many songs where they\'re devastated when they no longer have her, because they\'re not allowed to have any other emotional support or even contact. That is deeply, deeply inside the gender box.  To me those songs are showing one of the worst issues surrounding manhood, I could never see this as a celebration of men or men\'s love, or men\'s vulnerability. It\'s only expressing love through the very limited lens men are allowed to experience it, romantically. It\'s not celebrating the openness of men to whatever emotions they may experience, it\'s celebrating men hurting because it\'s manlier not to have a support system."

What that means is that I minimize the time I spend focusing on the unfairness in the world or thinking I can control it. Nothing I do is going to make strangers stop misgendering me because it is bigger than myself, it\'s an entire global system going back who knows how long. Ultimately what strangers do is not my choice. That doesn\'t mean the actions are ok or not hurtful, because they still are, it just means focusing my time and energy on things I can change or that are fair.  While in a ideal world, we would be able to depend on others for things like validation of our genders, we don\'t live in that world currently. So I do some of that work for myself. I practice telling myself good things gender wise. I tell myself I am gender neutral no matter how I look and I correct it when I have thoughts that are hurtful -- like if I think ""that shirt makes you look like [binary gender]"" I will consciously think in response, ""gender isn\'t decided by what clothes you wear, I\'m nonbinary either way."" I find things that make me feel good about my gender and explore them, like clothes or ways of talking. The game changer for me with this was realizing that even when others validate me, the truth is that what I think and feel about myself is always much more important.  The links might not explain the concepts in a way relevant to you, I definitely encourage you to look more into them or research other thought coping mechanisms you can use :) This is the kind of thing a therapist would teach but there\'s a lot of focus nowadays on making these accessible outside of therapy."

I think just ""oh, I\'m not a ma\'am"" gets the point across personally. Some people have yet to fully understand that looks don\'t equal gender, even after they accept binary trans people.  On the other hand, I think there\'s a very weird power differential happening in these kinds of low level business interactions, and I don\'t think they can be treated the same as other interactions with strangers. I don\'t correct service workers when they misgender me in this way because I don\'t feel like my actual gender is relevant in that situation (not that gender is relevant in 90% of interactions though).  If it were reversed, I would hate to call someone ma\'am at work and get a reminder about being gender neutral while I get paid 50 cents over minimum wage, while I\'m constantly misgendered by customers and coworkers, and now being put in a situation where I either have to out myself or be seen as an ignorant cis person. I think the real people who have the power to change this are above my head -- in your case you know the employees were told not to gender customers, but for example my employee training often referred to customers in general with she/her. If customers left feedback saying to reduce gendered expressions or saying the gender neutrality they already experienced mattered then it would definitely make an impact."

Even pronoun preferences don't always connect 1 to 1. From this post alone maybe agender or gender apathetic might fit you, and those would be included under the nonbinary grouping. Personally I do feel the presence of a gender which is not male or female and that's why I identify with nonbinary as my main label, and neutrois as a secondary label because my gender is neutral. I think figuring out your gender just requires a lot of introspection and exploring different labels until you find one you vibe with."

Some nbs still identify somewhat with their agab, and if they\'ve always identified as straight before and they don\'t experience love in a queer way then I think straight is the label that serves them best. It\'s important to say too that only having straight attraction doesn\'t make someone any less valid as a nonbinary person.  I do think having a gender fully outside the binary like agender, gender neutral, various other nb identities makes you queer inherently, and I\'ve seen some arguments that contradict this which are really transphobic. Like the other day we had a thread where someone said they\'re """"""female bodied"""""""" and only like """"""""male bodied"""""" people like, bodies can\'t have gender and you just misgendered like every single trans person in existence."

You\'re damned if you do have dysphoria, because you have dysphoria, and damned if you don\'t have dysphoria, because then your trans experience isn\'t ""valid.""  I would spend more time thinking about why you\'ve come to the conclusion that dysphoria is necessary, and if that\'s more helpful than the ways other people think about transness.

Even though you\'ve left a box to clarify, the survey has you answer questions ""as a bisexual person"" which I inherently can\'t, since I\'m not. It\'s uncompletable. There\'s no ""not applicable"" option for me to use with biphobia, since I\'m incapable of experiencing it since I\'m not bi.  And the survey centers on bisexual experiences and stereotypes without touching on pansexual experiences -- for example there\'s no questions about the common issue of others telling us we\'re *really* bi, or *really* pan, and defining that for us from outside (or inside) the community. There\'s no questions about people telling us ""there\'s only 2 genders"" which is a main part of the panphobia I experience.

My personal experience was that when I first learned to use other people\'s pronouns, what really got in the way was outdated ideas about gender -- basically, me thinking that you can determine someone\'s gender by looking at them.  Get used to using they/them pronouns for *everyone* whose pronouns you don\'t know. Take more time to think before speaking if you need to. We want to respect people proactively, and not just make mistakes and have them correct us. You can unlearn the cues you used to use to decide someone\'s pronouns, like a lot of people look at hair length / hair style or whether someone has breasts or broad shoulders. Remind yourself that body parts don\'t equal gender and pronouns... maybe there\'s something specific about your coworker that causes you to use she/her instead of they/them, like maybe you think their face looks female or something? I would say things to myself like, ""X\'s chest is nonbinary, because they are nonbinary. Every part of them is nonbinary."" It takes a lot of time to unlearn if that is the issue though."

Transgender people who identify as male or female usually don't identify with transgender as their main gender identity, so having a gender question with just male / female / transgender leaves many people unable to answers since two of the options would apply. Nonbinary / genderqueer is the current accepted way to refer to people identifying as genders other than male or female, and some don't identify as transgender so that group would be unable to reply also. I'm nonbinary and I do identify as transgender, so the gender question was adequate for me, but having to mark my second-best choice and seeing outdated info certainly affects my opinion on the surveying organization.  I personally suggest asking if the person is transgender separately, and then having a gender identity question with male / female / nonbinary or genderqueer / other.

eRisk2023-T3_Subject17, b' ' , b'2019-05-26 06:51:27' , reddit post ,"Hi, thanks for responding--  My first impression was in the gender option. I didn\'t know if it was a mistake or not, but a lot of the answers overlap and the form only allows you to put one option. Like you have female, transgender, mtf, and transwoman, and it\'s a common misconception that these are all different. I\'ve also seen a lot of people calling ""transwoman"" an outdated term like ""transgendered,"" and putting a space in between trans woman. I take a lot of surveys here and I got used to a standardized gender question, so I originally thought you were a well-meaning but confused cis person because of all that    Past that, some of the questions are worded a bit weird:  I didn\'t know how to interpret ""because of my gender identity,"" I couldn\'t tell if you were asking whether those things happened or if you were asking if I think it\'s my identity\'s fault those things happened. There\'s no way to indicate, for example, that my family lost social support from neighbors, but it was because the neighbor was a bigot and not because of my identity (Not a personal example)  The use of the phrase ""has had to"" in some of the questions threw me off too. One of my partners and I are both nb, and we advocate for each other often because we love each other, not because we ""had"" to. There\'s no way to indicate your family has advocated for your gender, but by choice or proactively instead of obligation for example.  I also think the question about insurance looked different in juxtaposition with the burden questions. ""Paid for by my family or their insurance"" I haven\'t been on my family\'s insurance for three years but I always thought that was the point of a family plan, to pay for the medical costs of the family. And I wondered how you would interpret the data of a minor, whose medical costs are legally the parents\' responsibility. Or the data of someone whose parents offered to pay for medical costs because they\'re rich. And so on  Overall I just came out concerned that you were measuring how much my family ""had"" to do because of my gender, how much social connections my family lost because of my identity, how much financial burden I put on my family, which is something people like to argue that being trans is bad or a hardship on those around you.  Sorry for the long reply and the delay. I\'m just a really detailed person who thinks a lot about things. This is just my perspective as one trans person, ymmv.  Unrelated though: I\'m not out to my family or the general public, so many of the questions were not applicable to me."

In the future I suggest not doing that because it\'s extremely triggering and takes the power away from people about when and when not to disclose.  Here are the parts that are condescending:  >If your home living situation was not abusive and there is an option to make up with your parent(s) or caregiver, please consider it (even if it means a curfew, chores and hard work, or following rules you don\'t like)  The insinuation here is that a teenager has trouble doing ""chores and hard work"" or that the rules are home are simply bad because the audience ""doesn\'t like"" them... Consider that they chose to say it this way instead of using phrases that more closely validate a teenager\'s point of view like, restrictive curfew, rules that are unfair / disrespectful/*developmentally inappropriate*.  >Contacting the police may be unpleasant and you will need to listen to the police officer,  Honestly just... everything about this phrase is nasty. Teenagers just like adults need to know that cops aren\'t right all the time and can fuck up and can abuse. This little ""respect the authority of the cop even if you don\'t like it!"" would never be said in this manner to an adult. It mirrors the way kids are taught never to question adults, despite how constantly we fuck things up for them.  >You shouldn\'t be carrying anything illegal (drugs, alcohol if you\'re underage, or illegal weapons) in general regardless,  Can you imagine sneaking in a ""drugs are bad"" message in a post about helping teenagers avoid homelessness? Research literally shows that harm reduction strategies are more useful because total abstinence doesn\'t fit the realities of teenagers\' lives, OP is clearly talking from their position as an adult down to the position of the audience. Remember: the audience of the post, according to OP\'s own words, is as old as 19. There was no need to say this. ""Obviously, don\'t bring anything illegal with you"" would have sufficed and acknowledged that teenagers have been getting told drugs are bad since diapers.  Part of my abuse was having my agency and ability constantly doubted and being treated as a second class citizen due to my age. But you don\'t need to know that, nor did I need to write this whole post justifying myself. You could have simply respected that some people *don\'t like being talked to that way* and left it."

Everyone around us had a gold, platinum, or diamond crown, mostly platinum, so I assumed we'd get that when we finished in the same place. But lo and behold we're still bronze. Is it party age or something?  Edit: Also totally need new members. Vulpes, I did 110mil lux this past week and want to get the 300mil party goal! Give ID to join"

", b'2017-11-25 05:19:13' , reddit post ,"Decided to wait until I had a 20k+ score before starting the timer for the Ugga Drop challenge. Sent it, my 3rd score for the day. But the challenge still says incomplete, timer still running. Tried again and I got the red text ""Can\'t send more than 3 scores."" So no chance to get it done today? This is my first GMC afaik, so I really didn\'t know it would do that :/"
