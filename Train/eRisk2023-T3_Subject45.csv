This is such a hard place to be in, I can imagine that you feel very self conscious and unhappy, and the stuff with your mom sounds so hard. If you are close with her and knows she really cares about you, I really recommend having a very serious conversation with her about all of this. If you're too scared to do it in person you can try writing her a note. Explain that the way your family talks about your weight makes you feel bad, and you understand that she's trying to look out for you but feeling bad about your body has made you try unhealthy ways to lose weight. You can ask her to see a therapist (highly highly recommend this) and also a nutritionist if you want, to help you lose weight in a healthy way. You can also ask her to try and work on healthy eating habits as a family that don't include conversations about your weight and body. When I was 13 talking to my mom honestly about my developing eating disorder seemed unthinkable, but looking back it would have helped me so much. Best of luck  "

eRisk2023-T3_Subject45, b'Miserable' , b'2022-01-02 21:42:51' , reddit post ,"I just graduated college and started working at a small clinic in my home state. I\'ve always loved working with animals and seriously have thought about going to vet school for years. This is my first experience at a clinic, I did have an internship at a zoo hospital. I thought this was going to be a great start for right out of school.  My boss hired me knowing I had zero experience, with the understanding that she would teach me everything and I\'d get more experience and responsibilities over time. Sounded perfect. But when I got there, my boss and everyone else were immediately fed up with me because I didn\'t know what I was doing. Like, they were mad at me for not knowing how to restrain a dog (it took two seconds to show me), not knowing how to draw up vaccines, not knowing how to schedule appointments, even not knowing where things are in the hospital that they never showed me around. I feel like I\'m losing my mind. Like, I\'m not psychic, there\'s no way for me to know to do something unless you tell me. And when I ask questions, everyone seems pissed. Like the other day I was switching the oxygen over to the non-rebreather and I couldn\'t remember what plugged in where, so I asked and the vet snapped at me, ""I showed you this the other day."" Like yeah, I know, but I\'m trying to learn 100 things a minute and I\'m not a perfect person. I get scolded, snapped at, eye rolls all day long. I\'ve cried multiple times at work out of frustration.  And I know I\'m the new person, but the amount of shit work I get is so upsetting. God forbid someone else clean diarrhea. I spend so much of my day cleaning kennels, doing laundry, mopping, doing dishes. No one else helps with that stuff. Which would be fine if that was like, my job description, but I had no job description, I have no job title, and I don\'t have any official set of responsibilities. I know saying this is like very entitled but like why did I go to four years of school to mop floors?  Finally, the people at my job seem like they don\'t even like animals. Actually, one of the head techs told me on my second day that she doesn\'t like any animals. No one seems to have any kind of emotional connection to the animals, and they are all so rough with them in ways that sometimes seem appalling. Like, if a dog is freaking out about a nail trim, they will scream at him ""STOP"" and then throw him on the floor and pin him. I know this can sometimes be necessary but it happens so often. Also, everyone has no tolerance for dogs barking and freaks out when they bark for more than a minute. The loudest dogs get put in a cage alone in the basement, and no one checks on them all day. We board dogs frequently and one of our boarders was a barker, so she stayed in the basement for the week she was there, only getting out four times a day to pee. Like isn\'t that... animal cruelty? Am I being excessively sensitive?  Is this normal? I feel totally miserable. I hate every second. I find myself jealous of people at literally any other job, from lifeguards to gas station attendants, because they don\'t have to deal with this. Am I being dramatic? Can anyone relate?"
