But ""while"" /wa\xc9\xaal/ and ""wow!"" /wa\xca\x8a/ are distinct for me: [w\xc9\x91ju ~ w\xc9\x91u\xcc\xaf] v [wau\xcc\xaf]."

""il y a"" is one of those annoying constructions which doesn\'t really have a 1-to-1 correspondence to english, so we can\'t literally translate it and use it in the same way we would in english (e.g. seven days ago since)    natives please correct me if i\'m wrong"

There\'s a section in chapter 1 explaining how newborns are able to differentiate between different languages: the example given is between Dutch and Japanese. However, it\'s also mentioned that ""the ability to differentiate sounds in two languages of the same phonological family appears a little later"".  A few questions arise from this: 1. What are these phonological families? 2. How many of them are there? 3. Which languages exist within the same phonological families? (an example of two languages which a newborn wouldn\'t be able to differentiate between) 4. When do babies gain the ability to distinguish these two, if ever?  I assume that phonological relationships and historical relationships between languages differ: considering that languages from the same historical family can sound very different (Russian and Hindi) and vice versa (Tamil and Hindi).  I\'ve scoured the internet for more information but with no success so I thought I\'d ask here. Any help is much appreciated :)"

It could be applied to the romance languages too as most of them derive their nouns from the accusative form from Latin and lost the rest of the cases (Old French is one exception). This could be a common phenomenon in historical linguistics?

eRisk2023-T3_Subject36, b'How do children acquire noun cases?' , b'2019-09-29 22:43:00' , reddit post ,"I would assume that children would choose one form of the noun which they find most common (e.g nominative) and use only that one or, alternatively, use the noun without case affixes. Or do children naturally begin speaking with correct usage of noun cases straight away? I've tried looking online but can't seem to find answers. Thank you for your time! This question has been on my mind for a while now and it seems so necessary to know as so many languages utilise noun cases."
