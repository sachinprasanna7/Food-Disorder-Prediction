But it's also a discussion- lemme know if I should change the flair.   Just musing on these things lately looking for camaraderie. It's that special spot between someone's most genuine and most misguided, where it hurts not because it's hateful, but because they mean so well.  The one that sticks with me the most was a coworker/friend who came to me crying after nearly two years of support to tell me that \xe2\x80\x9cGod still saw me as his little girl\xe2\x80\x9d and \xe2\x80\x9c God told me that he can't stand you desecrating your body, he still loves you, you don't have to do this to yourself.\xe2\x80\x9d  Again, she was in tears.

There are tons of ideas for what being trans looks like, plenty of assumptions and stereotypes, but I know for a fact trans (much like any other defining trait in a person) is a spectrum of identity, presentation, and-  I dunno in my opinion, not the most interesting trait about me? I've got so much other shit going on. We're all so cool, are you kidding me that this is your hang up.   Genital preference imo is a slippery slope. In good faith arguments I can understand it, but if often comes up solely in regards to dating trans people, and once more- there's a lot us. You're really assuming that all of our bits are the same?  Personally I'd rather be just. Glad that I like someone enough to date them, whoever they are, but that's just me. Love is rare, but sure. Narrow the search engine, we don't wanna date someone with these hang ups anyway.   TLDR: Yes and no. It's important to case-by-case when the opinion of \xe2\x80\x9cgenital preference\xe2\x80\x9d comes up, but most people just have a misconception of trans people in general.

And I can't stand the way my body has changed.   But I also know the journey from body hatred is body neutrality. To ask a challenging thought: what can your body do now that it couldn't before? What are you able to do being a step removed from your eating disorder?  You clearly know what your worst felt like, knowing what it looked like can be really hard.

eRisk2023-T3_Subject27, b' ' , b'2022-10-16 23:20:39' , reddit post ,"Instead of harping on someone clearly in pain and asking her to check herself- let's remember that in almost of our lives our trans experience was defined by the things that hurt us, rather than the innate joy that being trans is.  Like of course there is something to be said about the wording, but you can't tell me that a woman in pain doesn't take precedence over vocabulary.   It took me a very long time to find joy in being trans. It was a journey for years defined mostly by pain and struggle, but I was able to find ways to get comfortable in my body pre-and-post transition. I'm lucky, I redefined my experience with gender euphoria rather than the dysphoria that nearly ended my life.   OP, for a reframe: What if in this life, there is more than this pain? What if through all of this, you are seen as you are, you are able to (if you so choose) to medically transition, what if after all of this you wake up with a comfort and love for who you are?  We can't be sure what's at the end of this life or the next, that much is true. You are a woman. You deserve to be seen as who you are. I see you, I'm sorry things are this bad right now, that matters as much as the possibility that this pain ends. Death isn't a guarantee, it's a full stop.

I know mine previously opened up a line of communication between my parents and her, which took some of the load off of me. Your professional teams should advocate and speak for you. I strongly recommend talking to your team about it and a.) how to process the remarks and b.) how you felt about it, how to explain your efforts without stepping out of your comfort zone.   I know in my own experience, I never fully went into depth with my parents. They didn't know, no one knew, but I disclosed sometimes the Current aspects of my treatment.

If you're cleared for mild exercise, I find a leisurely walk (10-15 mins max) after a meal helps. Hot water bottles help a lot too, just something warm against the part of you that aches. Slow breathing, distracting activities to keep you busy through the worst of it, it's hard but I promise it's worth it.   Wear clothes with stretchy waistlines, loose fitting fabrics, to welcome your shape. Sweatpants were a godsend to me at this time.   This was the hardest part of treatment for me, believe me I sympathize. You're going through it and you still *are* and that's so amazing in itself.   If it is a comfort, and I'm not sure it is, my own experience with refeeding lead to a slow return to my healthiest weight. I was also still engaging in behaviors at the time.

My ED fought for every scrap it could. That alone left me harrowed.   It takes effort, but recovery leads to the place where there is not exhaustion, but relief. I know that I was on high alert mid-recovery waiting for the other shoe to drop, and trying to understand myself came with an intense exhaustion in itself.   Your body is adjusting, and so is your brain and your you. You're doing the right thing. An electrolyte check can never hurt, but at the very least you're Heard. I'm super super proud of you."

Think about all the other things you could do if you didn't purge, remember that these little steps, these discomforts, make it easier in the future to detatch/detangle from your ED. Your ED does not have to control you. It can just be this- just sitting with your parent having a nice conversation.   To ease symptoms that make me feel the urge to purge, I usually do a leisurely walk after meals, rely on ginger or peppermint tea, sometimes I really just keep myself rooted to the spot with a wheat bag or hot water bottle.  I actually found a particular video game (Pok\xc3\xa9mon, its Pok\xc3\xa9mon.) keeps me rooted so I can't \xe2\x80\x9cpurge until I finish this level/battle\xe2\x80\x9d and end up staying longer anyways.

Tread lightly on forums like these, but I'm so glad you are in her life trying to assist her best.   Here are some basic ED-focused to-avoids. It's not at all extensive and all-encompassing. Everyone has different triggers, but let's do some simple ones:   - be mindful of mentioning \xe2\x80\x9cbad\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cunhealthy\xe2\x80\x9d foods. for one, there's no such thing, for two, it puts an unnecessary stigma on certain types of food choices that someone recovering doesn't really need.  - do not comment on your friend's body. it might be changing, that's okay! that's also good. - try to avoid \xe2\x80\x9cweight talk\xe2\x80\x9d, be it someone's body changing (a friend, a parent trying weight loss, etc) or the time your doctor weighed you. weight is stressful (and does not correlate with your health, BMI is a lie!) and it doesn't need to be blabbed about. it's literally like. the least interesting thing to talk about.  - do not ask direct questions regarding treatment (!!unless your friend brings it up first!!) keep things light unless she invites the conversation. treatment is uncomfortable, it's raw and tiring. if she brings up passing stories, that's cool! things like \xe2\x80\x9cso you're better now?\xe2\x80\x9c or \xe2\x80\x9chow is recovery going?\xe2\x80\x9c can be overwhelming.   and- if you're close enough- ask your friend how you can support her. i think it's particularly hard being asked what you need, but treatment centers do prepare you on average for Knowing things. she might want distracting conversations during meal times. she might want space. she might want someone to talk to, who doesn't hold her with kid gloves. there are easily things that are harder for her to deal with i didn't mention- she might ask to not bring up certain foods or health talk, or even just things that seem weird. she wouldn't ask if it didn't matter.   as a final note, you're a friend, not a counselor. know your boundaries and emotional bandwidth. your friend likely (hopefully) has a team of professionals wiling to talk out the tough stuff. she cares about you too. treat her as you always do, tell her you love her and you support her- give a hug, if she'd like one. take care of yourself first, and the rest can come with it.   best of luck."

I saw my sibling go through some cycle of disordered eating, and my parents commented on their own bodies a lot. While my sister seemed to gotten better since then, I didn't forget it. I have memories around 17-19 binging and purging, yet I still had very\xe2\x80\xa6 I dunno, times when I wasn't focused on my body at all. When I was fine.   When I hit university I went to the gym more often than I ever had. Then I had a professor talk about committing to my values, and I changed my food lifestyle for good. Which exacerbated my long dormant cycle of guilt surrounding food. I kept at it for about 3 years before I sought ED treatment on my own volition.  I only label this all out to say, I was lucky. I didn't have family members commenting on my body. I had peripherally disordered eating habits and mindsets, but I later came into my eating disorder on my own. I wasn't that picky as a kid. Prior to my dietary restrictions, I really had an expansive palate willing to try everything at least once. I'm still gaining that back. I hope I will in time too."

Both ends are going to be affected by this. I've read about people losing the \xe2\x80\x9cgood bacteria\xe2\x80\x9d in your digestive tract and mostly you gotta put something in, be it probiotics via nutrition (yogurt, kombucha, etc) or pills.   I would recommend, tenderly, that if this is something out of your control to seek professional help. Via a doctor's appointment for this singular GI issue, or something more focused on the core problems at hand if you are able to seek any sort of treatment. These side effects really stack up to permanent damage: bone loss, people on here have talked about prolapse and needing surgery, organ failure, heart problems, esophagus deterioration. I'm not saying this to scare you, but I also\xe2\x80\xa6 am? You saying it won't stop you should be frightening to think. I realize EDs really prevent you from thinking rationally, I'm there plenty, but I always benefit from hearing someone else tell me that \xe2\x80\x9chey, that's not normal, that's scary, it should be a red flag.\xe2\x80\x9d  Be very, very careful. These sort of \xe2\x80\x9cside effects\xe2\x80\x9d  is not just on top of your behaviors, it is your body raising alarm bells and crying out for help."

Eat soft foods, or nutritionally dense, easy to digest meals. (Soups are my friend when I'm particularly spent, miso soup especially.) Drink water. Drink tea.

I will say what my dietician told me in treatment: Things scream louder when they're dying.   Your ED is seeing your drive and intentional recovery, and that can lead to thinks like symptom swapping (I didn't feel the urge to binge until I kept myself from other behaviors, for instance) or these hard spikes in urges. But behaviors don't mean you haven't been doing the right thing.   Recovery is really really hard. I really feel you on that. But I also know that every time you complete a meal, or mindfully partake, or fend off the urge for five extra minutes or ten or a whole evening- you're beating your ED. It's hold does get less, and these spikes get less frequent.  It's also totally natural to feel these maladaptive coping skills come up with things going on in your life. They've served you in the past, they just don't serve you now. Keep doing what you're doing. Find a new distraction or keep close to someone you trust to ride out the urge wave. You're going to be okay, success or challenge, you're going to make it."

When I'm deep in my Eating Disorder I can't focus on anything else, but now that I've renewed that determination to get better, I feel like I did in treatment. I can't write or draw. I can't focus or read. I'm too focused on the moment to moment to reach outside of my ED OR my recovery.   I know this is necessary. I know this is the path to getting better (I've done it before, I know it's possible) but that doesn't mean I'm happy with it. When I was in limbo, fighting the ED but allowing it to take up space, I could do other things. Now all my energy is taken up again.   It's a weird double standard. If I want my life back (I do, I do) I have to give it just a little bit more. A bit longer.   I just wanted to know if anyone's felt this too.   For those who need some hope: it gets easier. Step by step, over time. You can still slip up but be in recovery. You can still fall but be in the right path.

Those sorts of things. That doesn't mean break up with your partner or w/e, find who makes you warm and keep em close! And by no means am I attempting to be accusatory. These are questions I have asked myself. I just always, always question those thoughts when they came up. I dunno about you but I was raised pretty hardcore in gender roles. Lotta research, lot of growth.   That said about T- yeah. T gave me a weird relationship with sex, I definitely struggle with it a lot. You're not alone there. If ace is the shoe that fits by all means use it. Sex-neutrality or sex-positive ace folks also exist, so welcome if that feels your vibe!"

When people hit this point I personally have come to the conclusion that I don't need to \xe2\x80\x9cchange them,\xe2\x80\x9d and more importantly it is Their job to do the work and research to figuring out their shit.   If you want to be direct, a text stating your feelings and why you don't want to spend time with someone invalidating your entire experience. You *could* give them a chance and point out your history together, or you could just state how you feel and close that door.   I'm personally a painful \xe2\x80\x9cI'm antsy if a door is left open so I slam it on my way out\xe2\x80\x9d but that is not the way you have to live your life.   For what it's worth: I'm sorry.

I just know \xe2\x80\x9cfemboys\xe2\x80\x9d can be a bit of a charged term in some circles. You're by all means allowed to find them attractive, but not everyone people consider a femboy calls themselves one, y'know?  You can experiment too. Even if you just poke around in online circles calling yourself bisexual or pansexual, or straight! You are under no obligation to have yourself figured out. I have yet to meet someone who does."

We notice when people are attractive (through societal standards, but beauty conventions is a whole conversation) it's perfectly normal. You are perfectly fine looking at attractive people and telling them they're attractive. Guys don't hype each other up enough."

Any mental health issue is sometimes like operating with blinders. Anxiety makes it hard for me to see logical solutions, or overthink the simple. Brains are fickle, tricky things.  There are many things that a sick brain tells us, so many of them are lies. You aren't foolish or guilty, you didn't know. You could not have seen the answes around you given your situation. People who cared for you showed up when you needed them. You don't *owe* them anything, you are here. For them, clearly, that is enough.  As someone who had survived a number of paltry attempts, much without the knowledge of my loved ones, it's okay. It's okay, and I'm so glad you had people to support you through the aftermath. (Because regardless or not the intent an accident like that IS trauma, attempts ARE trauma. You are a damn champion for writing this out.)  Happy you're sticking around longer. There's a lot in this world to look forward to. And that's where you are- forward! Learning as you go, leaving the past behind to carve a better future."

If you're part of the club, feel free to rib/etc, if not- their intonation to the comment speaks a lot to get off of. (Are they anticipating a response, is it spoken neutrally/warmly/negatively, is it a one off comment or a topic they wish to discuss?) Mostly, I mind my own. This is one of those topics I believe that if you're not in the same club, it's time to take a backseat and listen.   Given the situation, you could also ask what they need. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want support or an ear?\xe2\x80\x9d If it's just a one off, let them define themselves how they see fit. If that's the word they use out of self-love. Sure. Hype em' up. everyone's body is their own business. I don't ever think that it's really appropriate to comment on someone's body.  \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I love you\xe2\x80\x9d is not always the take (you don't love them \xe2\x80\x9cin spite\xe2\x80\x9d of their fatness, do you?

Center your belief in the notion that you are worthy (even if worth is something you struggle with, because everyone struggles with it) of something else, something more, and you go on. Slowly, surely, step by step. Forgiveness doesn't come easy, but (I believe, I hope) comes eventually. You don't need to forgive yourself to start healing. In my experience, you start healing to someday forgive yourself.   I love you. I hope you're okay."

However, in my experiences in my major of study I'm entirely outnumbered by cis people. the campus is primarily white, a little overwhelmingly so, and often not intentionally bigoted, but ignorant. i've had issues of transphobia with students (never with professors, though) and i do not feel comfortable outing myself in most circles. simply put from my own experience: the staff try, if they know. the student body themselves are not one i put a lot of faith in.   due to my own introversion and discombobulated state (mostly due to the college atmosphere in general) i didn't spend a lot of time in the aforementioned clubs, but i can tell you the time i spent there was valuable. i believe places like shades of pride and QUEST and all of the above are entirely necessary. they're open and welcoming and the counseling center has also been warm to lgbtq+ students.  through my own wariness of the College Experience, i'll say tread lightly. there are some incredible staff members dedicating to helping (the associate dean of admissions, joe, comes to mind. he was so helpful for me moving forward, as well as jennifer iwerks who helps run SOGIE.) but you really have to find your niche. i wouldn't call jmu a diverse community, and certainly not a wildly liberal college overall, but there are people in the right places. you simply have to work to find them.   hope this helps. :-)"
