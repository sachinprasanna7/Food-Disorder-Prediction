Allow yourself to feel whatever negative emotions you're feeling right now. Rage, frustration, disappointment. Express it. Don't hold it against yourself, but also, don't get mad at yourself for feeling frustrated. It's normal. It's okay.     After expressing your feelings, find out what exactly went wrong. Was it your preparation? Lack of knowledge about the mark scheme? Lack of time? Concepts? From that, reverse-engineer it. Talk to your teacher if you have questions. Redo the questions you got wrong. And, most importantly, forgive yourself. You tried your best and that's what matters. And, hey, you can always improve from  here! :)"
