But they get faster, and they can take the complex patients sooner, by month 2 they can do a moderate degree of resus on their own. Our auditioning med students see 2-3 patients at a time, and the resident helps offload some of the work so the students can spend more time in the room and seeing interesting stuff.   In the same way that you expect your team to do their part of the list, we expect everyone in the ED will be pushing themselves to carry their weight. The difference is when we're inpatient, we get assigned half the list, whereas in the ED the expectation is that you'll be self-governing. No one is assigning you patients, but we notice when you've spent a loving hour carrying one patient and you're not jumping to pick up another while the senior is carrying the rest of the board."

Then they need repeat labs. \xe2\x80\x9cTitrating the treatment to response and trending labs on stable patient\xe2\x80\x9d is definitionally medicine. If we had an obs unit I'd do it myself, but we don't.   Also, these days I'm seeing half my patients in the waiting room. Our volume overwhelms our supply of rooms. If someone's workup is done in the waiting room they can certainly be admitted from there.   I would actually love an ED obs unit though, because there really are a lot of patients who don't need a full admission! They need ten hours of treatment, or some extra time for case management to arrange home oxygen, or some other thing that is not worth a second H and P. The hospitals I work in though are community sites; they'll never build out the infrastructure for that nor will they staff it. So here we are."

Any surgical subspecialty that has small residencies - uro, ENT - the programs are often only 2-3 residents so the residency is a ton of call although depending on your practice it gets better after that. Interventional cards is a long road and as an attending you still take STEMI call and sometimes PERT call."

The 6am rush is different than the 4pm rush, bad traumas and super septic people can come at any time, nights are very different from days in terms of resources and consultants - so you have to do a lot of all of them so you catch every facet of the ED workflow. But it can be rough.   Attending hours are generally both better hours and far, far fewer, and often more consistent."

Asymptomatic HTN should almost never be managed from the ED but every primary sends me a few patients a week, either from the office or sent in from home, for a systolic of 180. A ground-level fall in a healthy person ages 1-60 should almost never require an ED visit; do not send the patient in \xe2\x80\x9cto get a CT.\xe2\x80\x9d Do not promise the patient that I will order their MRI because it'll be faster that way; I will not and it will not be.   I understand that everyone wants to shield themselves from liability, but then you make ME take the liability, which I in turn pass on to radiology and lab and the patient gets an expensive workup because normal, low-acuity complaints get escalated instead of managed appropriately in the office. Once they are in the ED it is much harder to de-escalate. My assumption is that this is how some PCPs foster a \xe2\x80\x9ctherapeutic\xe2\x80\x9d relationship with the patient; you're the \xe2\x80\x9cnice one\xe2\x80\x9d who always sends them in and I'm the mean one who won't order their stat whole-body MRI."

I'm wearing giant bag-pants that fall down constantly and then I rip the shoulders out on the first compression.   Also, I'm EM and I rarely get so stained that my scrubs require immediate trashing. I do get blood and body fluids on them occasionally but figs are surprisingly fluid-resistant; it's rare that anything actually soaks through. But most importantly I don't spend 10+ hours at a time messing with my clothes. I just wear them and they just stay on.

I knew someone was watching my back. Now I think a lot more about what I'm going to do when I'm out practicing alone.   My point is, your confidence is going to wax and wane over the course of your education. Think things through, make a plan, and then go tell that plan to your senior.

Programs cap spots for a very obvious reason - a department cannot accommodate an endless supply of rotators. Every rotator needs to be supervised, they need to have patients to see on their own, they need badges and logins, computers to use on shift, didactic lectures, structured feedback, a SLOE which is a department letter, etc, etc. Most away rotations occur during the first half of the year ie before and during interview season, so there's a time limit, and many rotations offer courtesy interviews to rotators so you have to make arrangements for all those interviews as well.   It's great to have rotators, I love having new students working with us, but it's a lot of work. We can't open up more spots because we can't accommodate more rotators and still give them a good experience."

Pros: I didn't really have to worry about money. Even without my parental safety net I knew I could afford car repairs, rent, a hospital bill etc. It might hurt, and I had to budget, but I didn't have to worry. Also, it's good for my self-esteem to have a job and a role. I do better if I have a bit of structure so I learned how to manage myself.   Cons: I did not spend my early twenties being carefree, traveling, going on big adventures with friends. I had a good time and partied my fair share but you know, I had work in the morning. There are a lot of once-in-a-lifetime things that are just easier to do at 23 than at 33 and I didn't do them."

But they are stably specialized in fields where they have appropriate supervision - mostly inpatient surgical, where they work closely with the surgeons. Because they've worked the same job for several years they're very good, very knowledgeable. But they aren't performing any solo surgery and they function in a midlevel capacity, ie primarily as data gatherers who help triage and expedite patient care. The final recs still come from the surgeon.   Most of the CRNAs I know make me nervous, because most of them entered the field: to get away from bedside nursing, to have more independence, and to make more money. Compare that to an anesthesiologist, who chose the specialty because they enjoy and excel at procedural physiology at a very advanced level. It's just not the same.   Similarly, the whole \xe2\x80\x9cyou can change specialties whenever you want\xe2\x80\x9d thing - well in my mind that's not a good thing. Each specialty requires specific training to be minimally competent. There's good reason that I can't just decide I'm a cardiologist and open a practice tomorrow. So I'm not sure why it's seen as acceptable/a benefit that a midlevels can move between specialties without any kind of accreditation or proof of appropriate supervision.

Any statement about lifestyle for new grads will be speculative until we see how things shake out.   Additionally, the wilderness + EM job sites are completely saturated and the pay reflects that. There are not paying jobs for new grads in Colorado. Leave that fantasy out of your calculations.   Psych is the medicine of psychiatric diagnosis and medication, not the medicine of psychology. You will definitely have the ability to spend a lot of time talking to patients, but a major component of the job is managing medications. If you like that then you'll like it.  Psych gives you the ability to do private practice, independently or in a group, which essentially does not exist in EM. You'll have to care about a patient's insurance, which EM never does, but you'll have more flexibility and autonomy.   Just my thoughts. It turns out for me the common theme was \xe2\x80\x9cstress\xe2\x80\x9d ie I like people in crisis, and both fields have a lot of that."

You also have the benefit of having extremely even footfalls, which has pros and cons. Finally, you probably have the benefit of AC and water which in Arizona is a major thing.  A few thoughts: you will likely be slower outside than your are on a treadmill. You should start in the early morning or evening to avoid the peak sun. You should plan short runs initially until you figure out how to comfortably go a few miles without water in a dry, hot environment. Also plan to run in areas you're familiar with to start. You may eventually need different shoes, as your local terrain may be harder on your joints (and on your shoes) than a treadmill. Be safe! Have fun!"

Not that you aren\'t smart or that you won\'t ultimately be proven correct, but right now it\'s ""third-year med student"" vs ""committee of highly qualified, experienced clinicians and researchers."" Again, you may be right and they may all be wrong, but you haven\'t proved your case.  For me personally, you haven\'t argued a convincing link from hysteria to SSD, so right away the rest of your post is undermined since I\'m not convinced of your initial premise. Additionally, undertreatment/underinvestigation is also an issue for patients of color, which you don\'t address - you could argue that that is outside the scope of your post, which would be reasonable. When there are many confounding factors (age/race/SES/etc) it is difficult to say anything particularly conclusive without very careful study.   You may want to more narrowly define the area of focus. ""Women"" is a large, diverse group and ""women diagnosed with SSD"" by comparison is an extremely small, likely much more homogenous group, so your point would be strengthened by drawing a clearer connection from ""women"" -> women are historically undertreated/understudied/""just stressed"" diagnoses -> SSD diagnosis. Clearly, not all undertreated women end up with a diagnosis of SSD, so you need to account for that difference if you want your issue with the diagnosis itself to be taken seriously.   As a final point, I now have one (1) year as a doctor and I feel comfortable saying some people absolutely have a psychiatric disorder relating to their health, and most of them are adamant that psychiatric treatment won\'t help them. People with many kinds of psychological disorder are adamantly against getting treatment. That in my mind is not evidence for or against a diagnosis."
