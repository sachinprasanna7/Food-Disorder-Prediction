Some people like me still enjoy femininity or masculinity while not feeling connected to female or male labels.   Me personally, I was assigned female at birth and even though I love dressing feminine and stereotypical girl interests, I still feel heavily disconnected from she/her pronouns and labeling myself a girl, so thats why I feel more connected to nb as a label.   It can get really gray and everyone's reasoning can be different, but if he says he feels nb, id be inclined to believe him and ask how I could help during his time contemplating this.

This sounds most like bulimia or anorexia binge/purge subtype from what you said but I can't say for sure obviously.  Eating disorders often go in cycles or are not very specific which can make it seem like they never fit neatly into a category. There's also OSFED which is Otherwise Specified Feeding/Eating Disorder which encompasses an array of things like: Purging Disorder, Atypical Anorexia, Night Feeding Syndrome, Diabulimia, Orthorexia, etc.   I'm sorry she's going through this as I'm currently dealing with this shit as well and know it's no fun for anyone involved. My best advice to give is just be supportive and patient. Don't watch her like a hawk or anything, but just passively pay attention to her physical and mental state as eating disorders can have a quick downward spiral. I would recommend she seek therapy, but I know it isn't a realistic choice for some people. I wish you both the best of luck [heart emoticon]"

I was afraid that I made a mistake and it took me a while to get used to it- it mainly messed with my head surrounding how I would have sex with my partner now but that is more attached to some trauma I have than just because I had surgery.   As for the emotional roller coaster, I think telling myself that things will be okay and that what I'm feeling is only temporary helped me the most. Instead of instinctively pushing away from discomfort I would sit with it and that's how I was able to explore my identity even more because I let myself feel the possibility that I didn't fit neatly within the binary. So before surgery I identified as male but now I feel closer to the nonbinary label, even though I don't regret surgery.  I'm not sure how the doctors at your gender clinic are but if they are worth their salt, they should be used to this sort of thing happening because it really is a common reaction to be freaked out by what you look like after surgery for a while. I also don't think you really need to disclose your feelings about your gender to a doctor during this, unless you feel like you want or need to, so don't feel pressured if you don't want to"

I think I was more sensitive than the doctors thought or something cause I always got the impression that they were surprised that I was in as much pain/discomfort as I was. I did get warned by a very nice doctor I had that people can have some strong feelings after surgery and it may feel like you regret it but it doesnt mean you aren't trans or anythinf like that. From what I've heard, its completely normal and your brain's response to something suddenly being drastically different about your body.  Also after having stage 1 bottom surgery, it made me realize that I might not want to put my body through that again and this whole process has helped me weigh the benefits with the cons about continuing with stage 2. At first it made me really scared cause I thought it invalidated me, but it actually helped me explore my gender even more, which I'm glad happened.  I hope this helps!"

Other criteria I've seen for DID is having inconsistent skill sets (like one alter can speak a different language but the others can't for example), amnesia (although if you don't experience amnesia, there is a subset of DID called OSDD1B where systems experience none to little amnesia). Dissociation is obviously a big symptom as well, and alters having different likes/dislikes from each other. I'm hoping some of this is new info to you, I don't have DID or OSDD, I just researched a lot about it cause I thought I had it at one point.

I still like to feel things deeply like that sometimes, so whenever I decide I want to be in that hyperfocused empathy mindset, I'll watch a movie by myself or listen to music by myself so im not thinking about being normal. Listening to just music will make me cry sometimes and pair that with good acting, it's even more.   But even then when I let myself feel everything I always by the end of it feel so sad that it's over that I almost regret seeking it out in the first place. Like as I drag myself back into who I am I just feel so depressed until I get used to it again. Or if I listen to music I'll get sad that I can't sing cause I live with people and feel weird singing when others can hear me.

When I was younger, I would often feel this overwhelming premonitory urge and have to hum until the feeling left me. I also used to have to chomp my teeth together, blink my eyes hard, and stomp/walk a certain way some times. I thought it was gone, but I've been having those premonitory urges again and for what feels like the first time in having involuntary movements. Most commonly my head will jerk back repeatedly or to the side or my breath will catch and I have to gasp or suck in my breath super hard and the feeling is gone. This tends to happen more when I'm stressed out and imagining or remembering something uncomfortable in some way. Then the more I notice it the more it happens."

I wash regularly and make sure not to irritate things too much during sex.

Next time I tried, after I experienced pain when relaxing my bladder. In the morning I tried and again and that pain got so bad I went to the er where they told me I had an infection. I start antibiotics and this morning I have my vcug. Trying to pee was painful this time instead of just afterwards. The doctors there also told me it wasn't that I had an infection but they thought I might have one. My nurse thinks my bladder is inflamed and irritated from having the catheter in for like seven weeks. My xray showed a little leak but the radiologist said it was basically nothing and it would heal on its own. I hope this means I get to have the catheter out... idk how much more I can deal with this pain."

While I know it sounds cliche, if she really does love you she won't care how much money you make. Another thing is just because she primarily likes women doesn't mean she can't fall for the occasional odd ball like a guy. My friend is the same way and is going to marry her now boyfriend because he ended up against all odds being the one for her.  Attempting suicide is obviously a much deeper concept than the first two examples you gave but just because you attempted suicide doesn't mean she's done with you. I think the thing that will help you guys out the most is you trying to train your brain to think differently about yourself. It's very hard to do but it is doable and done every day.

He would tell me how his friend and he planned to commit suicide. He actually did attempt before we were dating so i think thats what pushed me over the edge.

One guy started following me around and talking to me whenever he could until I just was able to start ignoring him and he left. Found out he had started stalking some girl around school and learned her schedule before she did. 2. Some girl in my guitar class senior year kept trying to get me to kiss her and I was like nah sorry already have someone. For like a week she tried and told me she'd follow me into the bathroom and that she wanted to bite my lips. That was pretty weird but eventually she took the hint. 3. Another guy asked me if my relationship at the time ended before December then I had to give him a chance and I was like uh I guess cause I didn't end up breaking up with my current SO until after December so the dude gave up. He was the closest thing I had to a stalker.

He tells me to make an appointment with a urology department close to me. I do but I have to wait essentially another week because they are all booked up. Six more days with this pain. I can't walk for longer than a few minutes because it either hurts a lot while up or will when I lay back down. Feel really debilitated and annoyed that my nurse never fucking mentioned that I needed it switched out until the last possible second. He also doesn't respond to my emails until a few days after when I'm supposed to rely on him for information.

I wanted to start hormones right as soon as I came out to everyone but I wasn't able to since I wasn't eighteen yet but honestly I'm kind of glad I had to wait. It made me realize I was sure about who I was and even though I was nervous to start hormones it made me happy when I did. Same with surgery.

Some people it will work for but others like me the gel doesn't absorb into your body properly and you're left with a low t level. Others I've heard it works very well with though.  I'm very certain pills in the US have been outlawed as they cause liver damage. There's not really a good time to go on t just when you feel you're ready. I don't know how long I would have taken to decide when to start t if I had been in control about it (my mom wouldn't let me until I was eighteen and I found out three months before my 17th birthday). I think waiting helped me prepare for it but I also really wanted to start t as soon as I could. That decision is all up to you. It's normal to feel nervous or apprehensive about starting t because it's a big change but if you feel it goes beyond that then I would wait.

While I'm not female I went through my share of anorexic tendencies in high school and was thankfully able to pull myself out of it like you. I think a lot of people don't know that it isn't just a little phase and you're done with it. It stays with you even after you're doing better. And to constantly hear these comments could very easily make someone relapse. I think you should sit down with her and have a conversation about it. Keep everything cool and stand up for yourself if she gets angry at you for explaining things to her, as I think she might considering what you've said about her. Mainly just reassure her you're not mad or trying to demonize her, just that youre trying to explain your point of view and what you're going through.

We were out walking and he's telling me he thinks there's something in his room because he feels very uneasy in there and has been having sleep paralysis episodes. He told me that one night he was trying to go to sleep and he starts feeling that gripping dread. All of sudden he hears someone loudly and sharply whisper his old name in his ear. He told me he just kept his eyes closed and eventually made himself fall asleep.. if that was me I'd freak the fuck out.

In pe this one girl decided to talk to me cause I was alternative like her and her friends. I hung out with her at lunch and met her friends and all that jazz. About a week or two later I decide to friend some of them on fb and start talking to them. I only really hit it off with her boyfriend and her though as they were the nicest and least boring. She then proceeds to leave her boyfriend for someone else in the friend group so I'm now the self appointed consoler for the boyfriend. Ex boyfriend I guess. We actually have a lot in common and become instant best friends between his depression and my anxiety. We both struggle with suicidal thoughts depression and anxiety for the next three years (two years for him as he is a grade above me) before graduating but during this time he tells me he likes me like three different times. He tries having other girlfriends but none of them work out and he actually starts experimenting with boys too. They don't work out either and he's insistent that he only likes me. It's his senior year now and he's trying his ex out again. This time I realize I fucking hate her and am getting jealous and finally I'm like yeah I have a crush on him. So I tell him after his graduation and he immediately dumps his girlfriend I dump my boyfriend and we start going out. I realize six months into it that oh shit I think I'm trans. I remember him experimenting with guys so I'm thinking there is a slight possibility he will be fine with it. I prepare for the worst though. Turns out he is fine with it and three and a half years after that we are still a happy couple. High school sucked ass but at least I got him out of it.

Needless to say it made me feel better than what I had been called before and I came to the conclusion that I probably was not cis.

After a while I realized this wasn't a phase and accepted myself eventually telling everyone else including my family.

I know most guys get more dysphoria about their chest but I don't get terrible chest dysphoria for me the bottom dysphoria is severely crippling. It's mainly just me getting sad that I can't have what everyone else does. That's why I'm getting bottom surgery started before top."

I would see it as a blessing in disguise. If you keep dumping on yourself just because you might have a certain diagnosis it will feed into your mental health slump. I know it\'s hard but trying to find the silver lining in anything can keep you afloat.  "

Before they were more of a full body thing or at least I felt it more throughout my body but now they're definitely more centralized to my dick. As for the transition period to this point they used to be really really intense before now and they have mellowed out since then.

If I were you I would come out to him as he seems pretty aware already that you like masculine clothing and such, maybe he already has an idea? I know of some people who identify as straight but make exceptions in situations like these. Not to get your hopes up but it still could happen, you never know. I hope everything works out well for you two."

eRisk2023-T3_Subject46, b' ' , b'2019-05-30 00:34:44' , reddit post ,I had this exact thing happen to me. Moved in with my boyfriend and by this point his mom had been consistently calling me he and by my name. She had had an emotional conversation with me about how she should give me the respect I deserve and from then had called me everything I wished. Flash forward to one da she slipped up and called me her and I look at my boyfriend and his little brother in shock cause it was just so long since she did that. His little brother then tells me she does this all the time. Considering I haven't heard her say this in a long time this can only mean she does it behind my back to other people. Needless to say I don't live there anymore.

eRisk2023-T3_Subject46, b' ' , b'2019-05-30 00:04:48' , reddit post ,When my boyfriend's little brother came out to his mom she told him to just be a lesbian cause it's easier. She also tells him she'll always accept him and be supportive of him and proceeds to ignore his being trans and deadname him and never come to his defense when his siblings joke about it
eRisk2023-T3_Subject46, b' ' , b'2019-05-30 00:02:45' , reddit post ,For me it took my mom about a year to start using my name and she still messes up on my pronouns but that's mainly because my dad was very against me being trans. He never actively said things to me more like he just ignored it. So she wanted to please both sides and wanted him to ease into it but recently I got surgery and she's been making him use the right name and pronouns more I think. As for my other family I didn't really talk to them but they were pretty respectful and right away used my name and pronouns. It takes everyone their own time and everyone has their own reasons. Obviously there are different situations and sometimes people do things to deliberately be assholes but sometimes it does just take people time.
eRisk2023-T3_Subject46, b' ' , b'2019-05-29 23:54:15' , reddit post ,Dude I get those doubts all the time. I constantly ask myself even after two years on t if I'm really trans and 'omg maybe after I get all done with my surgeries and transition I'll realize I'm living a lie!!'  The thing I usually do is remember how I feel when I catch myself yearning for all the things that scare me. For example if I'm scared or nervous about surgery I just think back to all the times I felt self conscious about my chest or felt nervous walking into a locker room or bathroom to pee. This is just what I do for me I'm not sure how your mind works but it quiets mine a bit.  I find it relevant to mention I just went through another big step in my transition that scared me and now that it's over with I feel very relived and happy that I did. I even find myself wishing I could have more faster haha. Don't worry friend.

She told him ""why can\'t you just be a lesbian it\'s easier."" He likes makeup so no one in his family takes him seriously and when he came out to the rest of his family his mom acted like he was inconveniencing her. She does the same exact thing as your family always deadnaming him and correcting people never taking it seriously like she\'s ignoring it. If I were you (Also assuming this would be something you could do) I would have another serious talk with them and see how they react. If they keep doing what they\'re doing I would either cut them out of my life (that\'s just me I know for some people this is extreme) or just constantly correct them including in public when they tell people you aren\'t a guy. Hope some of this helps."

I had my first checkup appointment which I had to go all the way back out to San Francisco for (I live like an hour and a half away but with the traffic more like three and a half). They told me everything looks good and I feel great except for the SP catheter I have in place. I constantly feel the need to go to the bathroom and can't sit down without feeling immense pressure on my bladder. I'm hoping to try some medication they suggested for bladder spasming but skeptical that it will work. I have an appointment to see how my urethra has healed up on July 11 but I really don't wanna wait all that time with this guy in my stomach. At least if I can't get any relief from this feeling. Any advice? Other than that I feel great."

He jumped off, fractured his ankle, started laughing, and told his little brother to get his mom. His mom wasn't too happy. Same boyfriend but a few years back, we were at his family's Halloween party and he and I were just messing around, roughhousing. We were trying to knock the other person to their knees or just make them fall over, and we were playing on grass. I stuck my foot down to hold me in place, and the rubber of my shoes pretty much cemented me to the grass while he twisted me; my leg didn't twist with me. Had to tell the nurses at the hospital that my boyfriend dislocated my knee, and it was literally the stupidest injury I've ever had."
