Anyways I started looking for more informations on the drug and omg benzo recovery is a thing\xe2\x80\xa6!   Before this I was prescribed zolpidem once, it really helped, and tbh it also made me feel like I'm drunk (in a good, pleasant way). Btw zolpidem is highly restricted where I live.  I guess what I want to ask is: is alprazolam very addictive? I'm seen many posts accusing the drug of ruining their lives, I'd still prefer not going down that path if I have a choice.   That said I've doubled my dose today and am planning on taking a third (it's 0.4mg for heaven's sake) and am drinking with it (very light beer only)  Am I showing every sign of a potential addict?

I've always known myself as a troubled person (I was and I am, so to speak), the thing is it's became like an unshakable part of \xe2\x80\x9cme\xe2\x80\x9d. And that's a neutral way to put it. What's even harder to admit to myself is that I'm somehow getting pleasure from an identification as such. Like every time I read about depression/anxiety/suicidal thoughts, I feel an itch scratched deep down in me, a shameful itch like in unspeakable parts, and it's now gently scratched. It's exhilarating even. Of course we know as a common sense that scratching an itch would probably revive it and make it worse, but I noticed the moment of satiation whenever such topics were brought up, and then followed by more overwhelming urges that I can't really describe (like yay ahahaaahaha now let's scratch that skin to the bones!).  So I saw in these reactions how deeply I'm identifying with the troubled part of me, and I think it's going to do me no good. How can I get rid of the old thought pattern, that has seated me in the role of \xe2\x80\x9cmentally disturbed\xe2\x80\x9d? I've found Tolle very helpful. I'd prefer not to read on some general introduction into the theories, and I'm looking for some more \xe2\x80\x9cpractical\xe2\x80\x9d (if that's the right word) guidance. Any recommendations please? Love and peace to you all!  Edit/tldr: I spoke about the main obstacle for me at the moment but I'm really asking for recommendations! Like what authors should I be looking into or what practices I might consider doing, since I'm a definite newbie here. I've been searching ofc and actually got a loooooong list noted but (pardon me for this), it's just too overwhelming, almost leaves me as perplexed as always, and it feels distant. Can I have some recommendations here if that's not too much to ask?"

Deep breathing, meditation, do something, just WATCH, worked for a while and next thing I know I broke my 7days streak in sobriety.  I know that dealing with drinking problems could be somehow different from nurturing overall consciousness. I still wanted to post the question here because the truest reason that made me want to stop drinking at all is that I think I should stop suppressing my problems and just numb all feelings with alcohol, in general its affects on my life aren't that much of a bother.  The problem is I CANT stay in the present moment! It's simply unbearable. If not alcohol it's going to be something else, and always something else so I distract myself, flee to wherever else than the here and the now.  How did you do that?

I've actually tried several different ways to begin this post and they seemed either suspicious or weird or meaningless: to write about myself and the partner I want in life is even harder than I thought! Please bear with me a little.  To make this thing easier I'm going to put out the facts first.  Demographic facts: I'm 26 years old, female, Chinese, can assuredly be found in Shanghai till June 2023, when I'm expected to finish graduate studies.  Better-to-know-at-first facts:  I'm really uncomfortable in any kind of sexual intercourse, I know it's a community for asexual people but no harm mentioning.  I would by no means bear children and it's not negotiable, having a human being grow inside me is beyond my wildest horror, and after all, bringing new life to this world is against my ethics.  I smoke and I'm not proud of it, but well it's hard to change and I don't see any good reason to, not yet.  I have a long history of mental issues, mostly eating disorder and depression, got the bipolar diagnosis once but I think the doctor was mistaken. I won't say that I've outgrown that history, but I'm indeed getting stronger, why, I'm writing an ad looking for partner now, you bet I want some good things in life.  Let's see what else is looking bad on me\xe2\x80\xa6. I don't think I left many stones unturned, maybe I forgot something but later. Now there's something about me that cannot be shown by facts:  I'm not religious, but definitely not atheist. I'm very interested in religions (especially Buddhism) and spiritual practices.  I'm currently learning German, at first it's because I wanted to go for the vocational training in Germany, but I've been told that it's not such a good idea. But still, German is a beautiful language! I began by reading Kafka's Ein Landarzt, which has been my favorite for years, then I ventured to read Also sprach Zarathustra which was such a pleasure at first, until Zarathustra spoke of going to women with a whip. Why, if Nietzsche had the fame of the great misogynist like Schopenhauer did, I won't be as much disappointed, but most people only know him as the mad guy crying for a dead horse which makes his profile kind of loving. I actually cried like a broken hearted lover, why Zarathustra why, I love your teachings so much and you only want to whip me??? My recent reading is Das Ich und das Es, it's such a shame that the I and the it should be translated into the ego and the id which complicated everything.  (please ignore those nosense above) I'm interested in psychoanalysis, literature (as I'm a student of literature), language learning and philosophy, those are my \xe2\x80\x9cfancy\xe2\x80\x9d hobbies.  My \xe2\x80\x9cnot so fancy\xe2\x80\x9d hobbies are thrillers, horror stories, true crimes, basically anything that gives you a chill on the spine, or a turn in the guts. I'm kind of a daredevil at times (which means when I'm not too lazy to move), and enjoy doing dangerous or unusual things just for the fun of it. I went to visit the cemetery at night because I couldn't sleep, made a ladder myself from shelves and chair to climb into my dorm window on the second floor when I didn't have keys, and I can ride a bike with hands off! Ah those are happy moments!  I'm not sure which city I'm going to be in after I graduate, hopefully I find a job in Europe, hopefully.  What I'm looking for is some serious, long-term relationship. I know you can't push such things and serious commitments are intimidating, but I speak of the ideal case scenario, and maybe in a very long time. What I forgot to mention above is that I'm also extremely introvert, I have no friends in life, barely some acquaintances, because most times I'd just keep to myself, how could you expect to make friends like that? But really, social with people even people you like is exhausting. I don't know if the metaphor is inappropriate but my want for long committed relationship is kind of like choosing good tv series (once chosen you get to watch for months even years) over good films, I want company and I don't like the trying and choosing period, I want to find someone and stick to the choice.  Well I can't really say what I expect in you\xe2\x80\xa6 basically anyone who's still reading here, and is interested, or have any further questions, please feel free to contact me."

So if the issue is not obvious....why didn't my employer have an interpretor that works just for him? Because he don't need one, best option for him was to hire one from local college just for the occasion. So as many employers. The issue is, interpreting occasions are relatively rare, especially with the covid. So either I work freelance with is highly unstable and, I have to say, very stressing because you're like constantly job hunting, especially as a beginner, I don't think I can handle that. Either some bigger companys do hire interpretors, I actually worked at some of them, and what I found out was, 'interpretor' is just a job title for them, what you really do is a lot of administrative work, and interpret when in need, so it's a hell of difference from what I did as a student, suppose I look for sth like what I enjoyed\\* 24days a month, such thing I don't think even exist.

eRisk2023-T3_Subject24, b'Any jobs that require a lot of field work or face to face communication?' , b'2022-06-21 15:53:47' , reddit post ,"Hi, definitely can use some career advice here. I'm going to graduate in 2023 with MA in French language and literature. I've been thinking a lot on what I'm going to do and what I know for sure is that I hate teaching (as much as I suck at it so no regrets), and that I'm a horrible, horrible procrastinator (I basically can never meet the deadline for my assignments and such behavior hardly changed no matter how bad the consequenses). I also believed for a long time that I'd better look for less people interactions because I'm extremely introvert, easily stressed and have a history with really bad mental problems. So I thought there could be literally no possible job at all for me.    Lately though my mind has changed. I realized that my true stressor does not come from the outside world, and it's certainly not interaction with people that I fear. Actually I get the worst anxiety when I'm forcing myself to do the work that I (God knows why) procrastinate... I think maybe I'm just bad at work that are assigned to me with a deadline, and I be the master of my time in between as long as I get the work done is my nightmare scenario. On the contrary if there's no time in between, if what the work requires is instant reaction and even improvisation, I think I can do just fine. I remember on my last year in college I worked for two weeks as an interpretor in some florists seminar, and I actually enjoyed it. Now there are much fewer occasions as such due to the covid, but I think maybe there are similar jobs? No or very little assignements, lots of field work instead of sitting in the office? I really can't think of many jobs like this, God I know so little of what are the jobs out there in the world! Any suggestions please?"

Ich bin 26 Jahre alt, komme aus einem Nicht-EU-Land und mache 2023 meinen Master-Abschluss (in franz\xc3\xb6sischer Sprache und Literatur). Aus einigen Gr\xc3\xbcnden (nichts Illegales) habe ich vor Kurzem  beschlossen, mein Heimatland f\xc3\xbcr immer zu verlassen, und jetzt erw\xc3\xa4ge ich das Ausbildung.  Zun\xc3\xa4chst einmal m\xc3\xb6chte ich wissen, (nat\xc3\xbcrlich), welche Chancen ich h\xc3\xa4tte, eine Ausbildungsstelle zu finden. Versteht sich, dass ich als Ausl\xc3\xa4nderin (und ein bisschen zu alt daf\xc3\xbcr bin) weniger bevorzugt werde, aber wird es so sein, dass ich mich mehr anstrengen muss, um eine Stelle zu finden, oder ist es so gut wie unm\xc3\xb6glich?

Eine andere Frage ist, ob die Ausbildungsverg\xc3\xbctung f\xc3\xbcr den Lebensunterhalt ausreicht... Ich habe auf einigen Websites gesehen, dass die Ausbildungsverg\xc3\xbctung ungef\xc3\xa4hr 800 Euro betr\xc3\xa4gt (das variiert auch sehr stark, aber ich spreche von der Allgemeinheit), reicht das zum Leben? und nat\xc3\xbcrlich meine ich ein sehr bescheidenes Leben. Wenn Sie von Azubis wissen oder geh\xc3\xb6rt haben, leben sie alleine oder brauchen sie noch famili\xc3\xa4re Unterst\xc3\xbctzung, um die Ausbildung zu absolvieren?
