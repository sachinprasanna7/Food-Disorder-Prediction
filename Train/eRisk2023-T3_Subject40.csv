When a student knows the worth and the weight of the knowledge they're receiving, they put more time, energy and effort into writing it down, digging deeper and memorising. Or less, depends on the student themself. Math is important not only to find out how much your bacon costs in the store with -25% off, it's also for logical and tactical thinking, it introduces us to physics, paradoxes, and such phenomena as equality, balance, and etc. This knowledge is pretty mandatory and as far as I know people who put time and effort to understand the rules of math (not necessarily sitting till 2 am trying to solve the square root of 82847472, as an example), are a lot more logical and have a better perception of most situations involving risks. That's why we're encouraging our students, especially those preparing for exams, to dedicate 95% of their studying time into formulas and their relativity with other equations, knowing how and when to use the formulas."

Every movement I did was unnecessarily more complex to burn. Doing laundry? Swing the clothes. Tired? No I'm not, cannot sit. When I'd be home alone, I would run around the house till someone came back. The worst part was that I knew I'm deteriorating and doing this to myself. Because I realised it, I had couple attempts at self-de@th, you feel so hopeless, everyday was terrific, I was dying.  But what saved me was ignorance. Stopped checking nutritional value stickers. That was the main ingredient of my successful and on-going recovery. It was weird, because in my heart I knew I was tired, and one night I just said \xe2\x80\x9cf#ck it\xe2\x80\x9d and the next day I ate stuff I wanted to eat\xe2\x80\x9d. It was just as painful as at the peak of my EDs, but when \xe2\x80\x9cextreme hunger\xe2\x80\x9d kicked in I felt unstoppable. Gained around 40 pounds and was close to a healthy BMI. Had some potential relapses after that, but I still choose to eat than not to eat."

eRisk2023-T3_Subject40, b' ' , b'2022-04-06 15:31:04' , reddit post ,"Answer: find the reason WHY do you do what you do. Why are you spending your time on this, if you don't like the process, what can you do to make it more exciting? When you'll answer those questions and find ways to reach for your goal, or perhaps live a lifestyle, that you want the process will be much more fun and not only the goal will seem like the only part worth it, but also the process. For example, you want to lose weight with exercising. You know your goal is to feel good and healthy, but as you're following the tips on how to do effective exercise, you hate it, you want to drop it, everyday is more awful than the other one, then I'd say it's not the right thing. Here you'll have to find some alternatives, that will be as effective and 10 times more fun and enjoyable. Have fun"

Thoughts about restriction were getting louder and louder. Found myself starving for a week and working out for 3 hours a day. 3 types of anorexia developed. I couldn't eat, weight started falling.

I'm recovering from a restrictive eating disorder and I'm currently in weight gain. I've been aware of things like extreme hunger and hypermetabolism, and I got both, but like heck I can't sleep at all cuz I wake up after like 10 minutes in a pool of sweat. Mind you, I sleep with a fully open window, it's like 20 F outside, sleep shirtless and pantless with no blanket and I'm losing my mind. I feel like at this point I'll need freaking ice packs at night. Does anyone know how to ease these night sweats? I was treated for insomnia, I don't want to disturb my sleeping cycle again"
