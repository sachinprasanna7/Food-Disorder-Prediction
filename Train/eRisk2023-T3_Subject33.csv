eRisk2023-T3_Subject33, b' ' , b'2022-05-25 12:09:36' , reddit post ,"Thank you! Congrats as well! I didn't use a tutor, as I preferred going at my own pace, etc. If you feel like you study better with a mentor, then do what feels right for you! If you're okay with taking it solo, then definitely just self-study. This saves a lot of money, and there are plenty of free resources online! Lmk if you need any more advice (heart emoticon)"

So I had to urgently contact the CollegeBoard because my second first name wasn't included in my Admission Ticket\xe2\x80\xa6. They have been really slow with responding, and when I tried to call them, their call line was jammed and put me on hold.   I'm scared that when I get to my testing center, I'll be denied. Would I still be accepted if I showed them that I did try add a name to my ticket beforehand? My face matches my submitted ID and my first and last name still remain the same."

I'm only able to start again now, and my last practice test produced back to 1200s :( any tips for getting back on track and cramming in a week? Thank you and goodluck to those taking the SAT this week!"
