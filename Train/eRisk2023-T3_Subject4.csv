The bill sets forth duties of the coordinator, including to work with state, tribal, and local governments to encourage coordination of various elements of the network. The coordinator must also encourage federal, state, local, and tribal government agencies to establish procedures for responding to active shooters.  Finally, the bill requires the Government Accountability Office to study and report on state and local responses to active shooters and situations requiring the issuance of a public alert or warning""  On what grounds could anyone possibly object to these requirements?"

Once I got used to eating within a window, my body eventually capitulated on hunger outside of it. I make sure my meals are as physically big as possible and full of fibre, loads of spinach, mushrooms and broccoli. Shirataki noodles are a constant staple and an excellent low calorie filler. And occasional psyllium husk adds to some satiation. The trickier part is keeping the protein high whilst keeping the total calories low. It's pretty much a cycle of fish, chicken breast and egg whites with the occasional bit of prawns, beef, ham or protein cheese."

""Designer sunnies"" for example, unrecyclable plastic lenses that cost them 50p to produce and sell for \xc2\xa3400. They spend resources to freight them to an Amazon warehouse. Customer buys them and doesn\'t like them. Van takes them back to warehouse. Amazon bundles them up into a box of general crap that people didn\'t want, like or need and sells them again. Van takes them to new customer in assumedly an insane amount of Amazon style packaging. Whereupon the new customer packages them up again, and send them in a van to another customer paying another e-commerce platform 12% for the privilege.  1. That is the most inefficient way of providing a resource to a resource user. 2. The intrinsic value of the resource is in no way reflected in the cost imposed on the user. 3. The environmental aspect of the operation is horrendous. 4. The tabloid media being used to market Amazon selling real world loot boxes to a generation of people trained to think with that mentality through live service video games is disgusting. What\'s the likelihood of getting a box of goods where the price paid is consistently lower than the combined value of the goods contained? If it\'s a high likelihood then why wouldn\'t Amazon just resell the products themselves. They like money.  Sorry to rant. I just hate inefficiency."

Iceland - Salmon Fillet (Frozen), 240g  Asda Smartprice - Frozen Prawns, 100g  Iceland - Freshly Frozen Whole Leaf Spinach, 100g  Iceland - Frozen Green Beans, 80g  Aldi - Capers, 2 tbs  Aldi - Single cream, 99ml  Philadelphia - Philadelphia, 90g  Asda - English Blue Stilton Cheese, 50g  Aldi - Edamame and Mung Bean Fettuccine, 184g (50g dry)  1. Defrost the fish and prawns in advance. I would normally place in a bag in a bowl of lukewarm water for 20 minutes. 2. Fry up the salmon fillets. Place the hob on a medium high heat, put some oil in a plan and place the fillets in skinside first and flip after 4 minutes. 3. Stick the spinach in the microwave until it's cooked. About 3 minutes on high for an 800W microwave. 4. Bang the fettuccine in a pot with some salt and boiling water. Adjust the hob so the water simmers and cook for 5 minutes. 5. Season another pan with garlic or whatever you fancy, medium heat, plop the cooked spinach in there. At this point you should be about ready to flip the fish. 6. Put the green beans in the microwave for 3 minutes on high. Throw in the cheeses and cream on the spinach. Mix it about a bit and cook until the green beans ding in the microwave. 7. Turn the hob off on the fish and the fettuccine and then drain it. 8. Toss the prawns into the sauce. Mix it about a bit more and cook for another minute. 9. Jam it all on a plate and sprinkle the capers on the fish  1379 calories 122g protein 87g fat 19g carbs  Good for if you've had a light lunch or your stupid car has broken down and you've had to start cycling to work and need to up your intake.

You'll want to focus on spinach (frozen is best if you don't like the taste, you can microwave it and mix it into anything for a bit of fibre and vitamins), broccoli, cauliflower is great because it's pretty much just water, Brussel sprouts and asparagus with butter and bacon (I'm getting hungry thinking about it). Psyllium husk is a good buy if you're struggling to get the fibre you need and supplement with a multivitamin if you aren't getting enough veg."
