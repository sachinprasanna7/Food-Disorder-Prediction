eRisk2022-T3_Subject18,, 2021-06-28 17:02:29 , reddit post ," I see, thanks for the video. You really have a nice onboarding screen! Probably the problem is that you are presenting the whatsapp login screen as a “full” container of your App. Usually Apple rejects applications that presents webviews as main frame. Although I’m not 100% sure this could resolve the issue, you could try some strategies:

– A) Split the screen in half, showing two viewcontrollers at the same time. One controller manages the whatsapp web login, while the other one shows some instructions or animation.

– B) Make the user willingly open the whatsapp login url page (by touching a button or something like that). Then open the url in a SFSafariViewController.

– C) Render the login web behind other view, therefore the user cannot see it. Extract the url from the QR and generate your own QR without the whatsapp logo, or just print a white image that could hide the logo over the original QR, and display it to the user. Don’t know if this is possible, sound like a hack and is extremely dependant of the login web… but I’ve seen worst solutions.

Almost forgot, I think it will be ok if you mention whatsapp in the description with copyright symbol and a disclaimer saying whatsapp is a trademark property of whatsapp inc or legal stuff like this… but I’m not an expert in those topics. Hope other users could enlighten us on this. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject18,, 2021-06-28 15:05:06 , reddit post ," Let me try to help.

Reason 1: if your promotional video or screenshots shows non iOS devices, even if they are wireframes or mockups, Apple will reject your App. To fix this, just update your video/screenshots and make sure everything you show is iPhone or iPad.

Reason 2: if your App name resembles or includes the name “whatsapp” probably you should change it. Even if other Apps have names like “xxx for whatsapp” , Apple is constantly changing their guidelines, so back in that day that name was legal, but nowadays is not. I think you can include whatsapp (with copyright symbols) in the description.

Reason 3: try to include a couple of screens with instructions, links to whatsapp official site or whatever, and remove any reference like “you must install whatsapp to use this App”… even if it is so obvious. Look for hardware-dependant Apps like smart bulbs or drone control for inspiration.

Maybe it’s to late for this, but don’t try to reply back to the reviewer in a “I’m right, yo are wrong” mode. In my experience, it never works, but being kind and positive  usually does. Upload a new version (remember to increase the build number) and include in the notes for the reviewers what corrections you have made to resolve the issues.

Good look and don’t give up… I would gladly use your App! "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject18,, 2021-05-05 15:24:27 , reddit post ," Within this four cities I would choose Santiago (is where I've been living the last 10 years), although you probably will have a good erasmus in any of them. Here's some thoughts:

– Santiago is by far the cheapest of all four cities, in cost of living terms. Is pretty confortable, as you can go almost anywhere within the city by feet. There are lots of places where yo can go to have a beer with friends (2€ in average) and they usually include something (a ""tapa"") with no costs. Also food is very affordable, and there are plenty of location to visit inside and outside the city. You can reach the beach in half an hour and it's surrounded by forests and hiking trails. The main handicap is the weather. It rains a lot, compared with the other cities, specially in winter. Also, folks here are very kind, but they are kinda introverts, so it takes time to make (local) friends.

– Bilbao is a great city, with \*really\* beautiful places around, and it's known for its gastronomy. But... it is no cheap. I've heard they offer some of the bests grants and helps students a lot, though.

– Valladolid: You will probably make local friends here faster, as people here usually appear to be disagreeable, but then turn out to be nice and extrovert people. As far as I know, is a quite expensive city.

– Alcalá: Can't tell much, as I've only spent a night there. But it is inside the Madrid area, so you will never run out of things to do (if you can afford it, of course) "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject18,, 2021-05-04 13:56:47 , reddit post ," Hi! If you are in your honeymoon (congrats btw) I would recommend split the travel in two parts, one for visiting, and one for relaxing. In addition to other suggested cities in comments, let me add:

**For visiting**:

– [**Salamanca**][URL]: It's a small city, less than 2 hours from Madrid (to the west). Lots of historical places, medieval and romanic churches and palaces, and good restaurants (My wife and I spent our wedding night [here](https://www.buenamor.net/?lang=en), very cool). Salamanca's  economic engine is the University, so nowadays is not at its best, but still enjoyable. If you are traveling by car or are going to rent one, you can head south and visit some picturesque villages like [Candelario](https://goo.gl/maps/o24MwYugV5DbwZGs6), [Miranda del Castañar](https://goo.gl/maps/gXNpv9FP3DCpQoxt5), [Mogarraz](https://goo.gl/maps/sQcotiMSMZWKmoaY8) or [La Alberca](https://goo.gl/maps/eyWSnnxcRAKY5j5e7).  All this places are in a beautiful natural environment and gastronomy there is amazing.

– [**Cáceres**](https://goo.gl/maps/x9fjDid79byj2YCg7):  Another rather small city, but full of beautiful corners and buildings. There are a lot of medieval villages around, like [Trujillo](https://goo.gl/maps/iVgGYZFYhCYnUjLHA) . (Caution: hot place in summer!)

– [**Mérida**](https://goo.gl/maps/TnY4RT4LBUjFcMs86): One of the cities with more roman ruins (actually, pretty good preserved) in Spain. Every summer, and I hope this one too despite covid, there is a festival (The ""Festival del Teatro Romano"") and they do theatre plays, concerts etc. in the [2000 years old roman amphitheater](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teatro_romano_de_M%C3%A9rida#/media/Archivo:Teatro_de_M%C3%A9rida,_Espa%C3%B1a,_2017_18.jpg). Very cool. But also, warning: hot place during summer.

– [**Gijón**](https://goo.gl/maps/WQmtpKbYFxseZZeD9): A city in the north of Spain. I always recommend visiting the north of Spain if you don't care so much about the weather, but Gijón has a very pleasant weather. You have beaches too, beautiful natural places and probably the best quality/price/quantity of food ratio of Spain. From there, you can visit [Santander](https://goo.gl/maps/6oj6NM9Ui3fHAiTJ7) if you would like to visit the Basque Country region or [Avilés](https://goo.gl/maps/V7y2bhM1pxW5cB9j8) if you plan to visit Galicia.

– [**Santiago de Compostela**](https://goo.gl/maps/6pHFdpQvTJHVHj7c8): At the heart of the Galicia region, this city is quite peculiar. It's the last stop of the famous pilgrimage, has its own personality (I can't explain this) and people are very kind. In regular, non-covid years there is a regular flow of tourists and pilgrims visiting Santiago, but most of the places –from restaurants to hotels– are not tourist traps. Also it's very easy to visit lot of places from Santiago (the coast is half an hour), and the region (Galicia) has plenty of legendary places, villages, temples, and unique stuff you can't find in other places of Spain. If your wife enjoys natural history (and/or wine), there is a place called [Cañones del Sil](https://goo.gl/maps/mHCkuKJupWaja9U5A), a river canyon in which hillsides people use 2000 yo techniques to grow grapes and make wine. You can book one so-called ""casa rural"" (which is basically a nice, sometimes luxury house in a rural zone) and visit places from there.

**In Portugal**:

– [Lisboa](https://goo.gl/maps/oJaP4VeVkVthBFKbA): One of the most beautiful capitals in Europe. Museums, buildings, leisure... worth it. From there you can visit several ""must see"" places, like [Sintra](https://goo.gl/maps/YYQvPkS1mfqiXRFS6) (google Quinta da Regadeira) and [Cascais](https://goo.gl/maps/pkuAdCRu6TT4fUAy6).

– At the north part, [Viana do Castelo](https://goo.gl/maps/kyLjLYnXKFWfA8QbA) and [Valença do Miño](https://goo.gl/maps/dzUQm8TnzTtnYLcHA), worth the visit.

​

**For relaxing**:

– **The Canary Islands**: Small set of volcanic islands, with black sand beaches, resorts and nice people. I've been in Gran Canaria (where I recommend  the [Meloneras](https://goo.gl/maps/zKTKwfeFcwTTix4u5)/Maspalomas/Playa del Inglés zone) where beaches and weather are nice, and all hotels have lots of facilities; Also in Tenerife, where I prefer [Puerto de la Cruz](https://goo.gl/maps/xFpZW6g6frDN7B848), but probably the south part of the island would be sunnier. You can rent a car and go to the Teide's top (the volcano). I've been in Lanzarote too, but can't recommend it. Tourist trap, at least in my experience.

– **Menorca and Mallorca**: Mallorca is a good place for relaxing, but it's been ages since my last visit, so I can't guarantee it. Never been in Menorca, but it's quite popular at the moment in Spain... therefore prices have raised a lot.

\----

Hope that helps. Also, Latin Spanish is as good as Castillian Spanish if you visit Spain, so don't worry. If your resources there are Latin Spanish but also easiest to find, it's ok. But if you are very interested, look for Spanish universities offering online courses. I've found [this one](https://cursosinternacionales.usal.es/es/cursos-de-espa%C3%B1ol-para-extranjeros) from a well-known university, but it's annoying that they are offering courses for non-spanish speakers but don't translate the page to english.

Cheers! "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject18,, 2021-03-10 00:43:29 , reddit post ," It’s a bit difficult to debug this, but have you tried the following?:

- If your function uses storage, check permissions. A couple years ago I ran into something similar (function running ok, then suddenly throwing errors). You probably have to configure it via Google Cloud panel instead of firebase console.
- Redeploy your function and try again.
- Copy-paste your function, and deploy again with a different name. Then try to call it from the App. If it goes well, the original function is probably corrupted.
- Check if you deployed it with the latest firebase tools, and if all libraries in your iOS and Android project are up to date.

Good luck, and please post here if you find a solution or whatever is generating this error "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject18,, 2020-11-03 18:17:51 , reddit post ," Take a look on [Firebase PubSub](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/schedule-functions) functions. It’s basically a cron job that you can schedule to do any routine (check teams, make groups...). It has very low impact in the project’s budget.

Another approach is to use function triggers to perform your tasks [link](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/database-events). For instance, when the user becomes online or writes some “i want to join a group” flag.

Of course, you can always call your firebase cloud functions directly ([link](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions/callable)) if you want to do it on demand.

Cheers! "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject18,, 2020-11-03 01:14:29 , reddit post ," Hello! I’ve a couple of projects in production with similar use cases. In my experience it is waaay easier to manage only one single firebase project with a single user auth management, an then separate each secondary project using different real time database or firestore nodes/collections.

You can achieve a good security level by using database rules (I think there is a good guide with practical examples out there, take a look here[Firebase database rules examples](https://gist.github.com/codediodeio/6dbce1305b9556c2136492522e2100f6)). You can also combine that with callable cloud functions instead of direct writting your data for an extra layer of security.

Said that, if you must use separate firebase projects, you can use the firebase admin SDK for cloud functions. You can initialize secondary firebase Apps with the admin SDK, each one with different auth, and use a callable function to send the user main auth account password (careful with this), create the user in the secondary project with same email and password, and then let the user know that both credentials are active. But man... this sound like a big headache... "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject18, Could exist a relation between depression/mental illness and paranormal experiences? , 2020-10-03 00:56:31 , reddit post ," Hello all. First things first, this is my first post. I like to read posts here, but I've never had any paranormal experience, and I'm not fluent at English so apologies in advance for grammar and also if this is out of the scope of this subreddit.

Some members of my family have suffered from depression and other mental disorders, some cases were mild, others were serious. Thing is, they have been telling me their personal unexplained experiences for years, including hearing steps or voices in empty rooms, strange lights orbs, premonitory dreams, feeling of being observed, etc.

I think most of these experiences have pretty logical explanations, so always considered it a spooky entertainment in familiar reunions and never gave them importance. Also, as several of these experiences took place when the witness were passing through a phase of depression or anxiety I didn't took it very seriously.

A couple days ago, my wife and I were discussing about mental illness and odd behaviors (**context**: she is a computer scientist and belongs to a research group that tries to do an early diagnosis of mental illnesses by analyzing the way people write in posts, blogs, etc. So far they have had some success, and their results have helped several people, both patients and doctors) and the question popped up: what if the unexplained experiences my family told me were somehow related with their mental health at the moment?

I made some calls to my father and my aunt (my grandma and my great uncle had some cool paranormal stories too, but sadly they passed away a few years ago) and got the following:

– When both my father and aunt heard footsteps in the empty attic, they where children (8 and 10 years old) and where sleeping in the same room, in a two-story country house. It was in 1959 and the house was recently built. But this was right after their sister died from pneumonia (obviously I never met her), so they were truly affected and, in the words of my father, having «one of the most terrible days of their entire life». This experience was followed by my aunt hearing a voice (of a girl, but not her recently died sister, curiously) some weeks later.

– My father claims that he dreamed with her aunt. In that dream, she didn't say anything; just stare at him with an unexpressive face and with a hand at her chest. That same morning the found his aunt drowned inside a water well. It was 1970 and something, the well was almost at the ground level, and everyone though she just tripped on and fell down. My father, who was very attached to her, became obsessed with that dream and was depressed for several weeks after that (at the point that he couldn't get out of bed or think in other things). Five years ago, my father had a heart stroke. Doctors told us that could be due to an hereditary disease, and now he is convinced that her aunt had a stroke and fell down into the well because the hand in the chest.

–  My aunt was diagnosed with a severe depression. Her husband and my cousin took care of here while she was at home. I remember seeing her a couple of times back then. She looked awful and smelled very bad (not like she were not washing herself, as their relatives ensured that. I think the word I'm trying to use is ""pungent"" but I'm not sure). Apparently during her illness, she felt observed by an invisible presence, even touched by it. As she was taking a lot of medications, her family thought she was hallucinating. She does not remember much of these events, but my cousin does, and still creeps her out, because she also started feeling observed sometimes.

I have read several posts here in Reddit were people who tells their paranormal experiences also tells they were depressed, having very bad times, lost someone etc. So I would like to ask, **have you experimented something unexplainable while being depressed, anxious, or ill?** Do you think this is somehow connected?

**\[TL;DR\]** I have the theory that people with some mild to severe symptoms of depression and other mental illnesses could be more likely to have paranormal experiences, and I'd be very grateful if you share your opinion or story.

Thanks guys, and stay safe! "
