It's very confusing and lonely and since I no longer live around any of my friends I feel so fucking scared. I think due to the stress I've relapsed into self harm again (cutting, starving, etc.) and I haven't told anyone, not even my boyfriend. I wish someone was here to tell me it'd be okay. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject1, Scared of relapse , 2021-10-13 04:00:12 , reddit post ," I'm having a REALLY hard time eating normally lately. Things were going good until my brother started his tirade of commenting on every person he see's body and my mother constantly pointing out calories and weight. I thought maybe I was finally ok with food and eating intuitively but I'm so scared I'm going to have a really bad relapse this year. Maybe even worse than the one last year I hindered a severe vitamin deficiency from. One that literally left me writhing in pain many times.

Idk I'm just so scared honestly. I want to have a healthy relationship with my body and food, but every time I eat or think about food all the harmful things my brothers and mother have done and said to me repeat in my head.

It's just a constant loop of ""fat people are disgusting"" ""theres no excuse"" ""youre not allowed to have that"" that appetite suppressant tricks, the diets, the calorie counting and everything they did at me at alarmingly young ages.

I know there is no good enough in their eyes, and it's an unattainable goal for people who probably don't even care for my health, but just want me to be skinny. But even so I find myself tracking my calories and fasting and exercising any time I eat again. It's just so stressful and scary. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject1, I feel like my only way out is killing myself , 2021-08-27 04:48:37 , reddit post ," Every year of my life seems to be crueller than the last. I can't seem to ever catch a break and I'm still living with the guilt of not being able to help those around me who needed it most, especially my mother. But that situation is a whole other thing that deeply traumatized me.
Ive had such a hard few years I've completely failed school to the point this is my third year in 9th grade. I always said if I repeated a grade id kill myself, there was no purpose anymore after that. And now that this has happened twice I find no purpose to keep going on, maybe it seems dramatic or whiny but I don't know.
Its either this or i just relapse into self harm and my ED over and over with no help from no one. I feel empty and hollow and maybe there are some good parts, but it mostly just feels like I'm going to end up having a life not worth living. I'm so lost and scared. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject1, DAE seem to relapse when a big change in their life happens?? , 2021-08-15 06:42:00 , reddit post ," For context in my situation I'm going back to school for the first time since March 2020 and I'm missing some credits, which really scares me. This is not only because of my relapse into my ED around that time, but a huge traumatic event I endured that sent me into a spiral of depression and etc.
I got better for a few months though, mostly wanting to for my boyfriend. He's struggled with his own ED before (he's recovered, thankfully) and I wanted to get better so he'd never have to be around that kind of thing before. But even so I'm good at hiding these things, he only found out that first time because I came clean to him.
But I feel like all that progress is shortly going to go out of the window because of school starting in ten days. My brain tells me I HAVE to look skinnier for my friends because after nearly two years I have no excuse to look like I do, even if it is unhealthy for me to think this way I cant stop it and it's really scary.

Have any of you ever felt like this? Or anything similar? "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject1, frustrated , 2021-08-04 01:14:09 , reddit post ," My mother has gotten a habit of constantly talking about her weight loss. I try not to let it bother me but today she said she was ""shrinking in weight"" and I don't know why but for some reason it triggered me so fucking badly and I'm fighting off the urges to go throw up in the bathroom right now. I cannot fucking stand her. She knows about my relationship with food and my body yet constantly talks about her ""shitty eating habits"" and how she's dropping weight. And when I tell her to not she gets fucking defensive. I've literally said to her face I don't want to hear about it because I don't like myself and she said ""I don't believe that, you just want to be a bitch."" I fucking hate her. She acts like she isn't the one who gave me body image issues. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject1, realizing how my family has affected me , 2021-07-15 11:48:29 , reddit post ," About 10 minutes prior to writing this I was in my kitchen getting something to eat. Recently my eating habits have been better and I've been pretty proud of myself, but as I was microwaving shitty leftovers I looked at the calorie label on a seasoning. It said what you'd expect. Though for some odd reason though I found myself overcome with emotion and remember a certain time when I was little. My family had always like to poke fun at me for my weight and eating habits as a child, growing up female (I'm transgender to be clear, he/him) it felt they put these weird expectations on me to be ""healthier"" when really that just meant skinny to them. I ate a good diet, but their problem was I ""ate too much"" in their words at least.
 I have these memories of them locking the fridge and cabinets and tauntingly telling me I'm ""on a low diet"" but the memory that stuck out to me when I saw that label on the seasoning was when I was about maybe 7, my mother had bought my favourite crackers and of course I was eager to eat them. But almost immediately my brother made a comment about calorie labels. How because I was on this ""low diet"" I wasn't allowed to have more than the serving size (very small mind you) and in the moment of remembering that my eyes started to well up with tears and I felt almost ashamed and panicked to be eating normal sized meals again. It felt like I was that tiny kid again, mad at my family for telling me I couldn't have something I wanted? Or I guess rather needed.
Only this time the only person telling me no was myself "

I was at my friends house last night in the worst fucking pain I'd been in for a while and oh my god. I literally couldn't fucking sleep because of how unbearable it was. He wakes up fairly early and he caught me like noticeably in pain and asked me if I needed something, but I said no because 1. I'd already ate at his house and was afraid of surpassing my count for the day and 2. I'd just generally feel bad if I ruined the mood at his house. If that even makes sense??

Idk it just sucks. I might tell him what I'm going through soon, I'm sure he'd understand. "

We may say this every year, but I honestly just cant imagine her making it to Christmas. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject1, rant abt my mother , 2021-04-23 01:03:28 , reddit post ," Recently we went to the doctor for the first time in years, and they took my blood. Mind you I had just ate 5 minutes prior to coming to this doctor, because I was in the car and being forced to.

They took my blood as any checkup would, and my results came back normal. The thing is my mother read my results COMPLETELY wrong, placing me on a diet and taking away all of my safe foods the day we got the results back. I had to open up to her about my ED out of fear and give her an explanation. She didn't listen though, and made it about herself per the usual.

Cut to a few weeks later I get retested and ask the doctor if I'm okay, and she replies yes. My blood levels were all normal and I was functioning just how any other person should. In short, I'm healthy.

So I eat one normal meal bc I figured after all that restricting it would be fine yknow. I deserved it I thought, I didn't even follow my mothers diet plan anyway bc of all the restricting I'd been doing. Thing is, she catches me eating this meal and fucking BLOWS UP knowing my test results are all normal (I'd told her they were, and even showed proof) and says ""You can't go back to eating how you were, you're going to get bigger, this is bad for you"" yadda yadda

And I'm just standing there!!! like !!!! you know all of my levels are normal?? and then she tries to argue ""your blood sugar is on the high side of normal"" ??? like ??? no  its not????? the doctor said everything about me is normal? and I'm just sitting here so fucking pissed off now like

She's put me on diets my entire childhood, and with me currently battling my ED her saying I need to stick to her ""diet plan"" even though I'm healthy and well pisses me off SO bad. It's like I wouldn't please her unless my body was emaciated and I was knocking on deaths door and I'm so sick of it. "

But some part of me says if I make any attempt to recover I'll suddenly become boring, something inside of me is telling me ""this disorder is the only thing you're living for, and you need to succeed at it."" (Even if it does happen to be actively killing me)

And ig essentially I'm scared if I get better there isn't gonna be anything filling that void anymore? There will be no big mysterious secret I hide from family and friends and boyfriend, I'll just be the self I was before my ED, and I don't know why that scares me so much?

Is anyone going through this or something similar too? And if you've made attempts at recovery did you feel like this as well? "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject1, How would I get my mother to realize my eating disorder? , 2021-03-31 06:12:01 , reddit post ," For context I wanna say I was always kind of a chubby kid, my entire family have fast metabolisms but I unfortunately inherited my fathers slow one.

 As I was growing up they made several comments about me and my weight, how much I ate, etc. It became so bad in fact when I was around 6 - 10 they placed me on what they referred to as a ""low diet"" something they would always berate and make fun of me for, especially my two older brothers, in daunting voices. It clearly wasn't just normal sibling insults either, they were teenagers saying this to a literal child.

In this time period my mother did things such as lock the cabinets/fridge so I couldn't get food, count my calories, force me to go to the gym with her, and eat under 800 cals a day. Which obviously isn't enough for a child, especially since I was a tall, mostly active one as well. On this ""low diet"" they basically deprived me so much I sometimes had to beg my neighbours (them being literal drug addicts) to feed me. It was only when CPS was called (for an unrelated matter) did they take the locks off in the kitchen.

But that didn't stop their comments, moreso my mothers. Her constant belittlement of my body, how I needed to lose weight, how when she was my age she was skinnier and prettier and had boyfriends every week. How I couldn't wear certain clothes because they ""didn't fit my body type"". She told me she was only saying/doing these things bc she ""Just wanted what was best for me""

The thing is though despite my being chubby I was never considered obese, I knew how to feed myself. I exercised. All of that.

Of course you'd guess this would have really affected me, and it did. Middle school is when it all started, I remember the notebooks. How I felt, all of that.

I was better for a while, and it was nice. Of course the thoughts still lingered but I was powering through. Now I'm a Sophomore in Highschool and I've relapsed hard. Probably harder than I ever have before. (Due to a recent traumatic event)

Just recently though I sat down and had a talk with her about my health after a doctors appointment, explaining what I'd been going through, but she didn't seem to get it. Essentially she made it about herself, rambling on and on about something I honestly don't even remember. I was too dizzy to do so.

That brings me to now, and how she just told me I need to lose weight about half an hour ago. Unsolicited as well. She said again it was because she ""cares about me"". But the thing is I don't know how to properly tell her what I'm going through without her making it about herself or her looking up numbers.

Do any of you have some solid advice?
