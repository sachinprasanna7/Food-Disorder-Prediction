He is not rly ED at all- he is the type that loses weight easily and struggles to gain due to various health and digestive issues and ofc I’m the opposite. As far as Ik he doesn’t have ED Although at times I wonder if he has like mild orthorexia.
he knows I purged a few times (irl I purge almost every day but I don’t want to break his heart and also like then I feel he’ll wonder why I’m not skinny)
Now for the most part he is so sweet and supportive and says he will listen to me whenever I need it and I rly appreciate that. but then he will side hug me and say stuff like”what am I touching??? Is that Belly fat?? It’s ok you can make it go away with exercise”. And then later that day will ask if Ithreww up after eating my (low cal Safe Food) soup earlier and at the time I hadn’t so I said no.
Then later he proceeded to rant abt how bad and unhealthy saturated fats and restaurant foods are and then asked me if I ate fast food and ofc I said no Bc fear food as well as the fact that I deleted all my food delivery apps so I can’t eat fast food anyways. But I felt mildly triggered for the whole conversation basically Bc like. If only he knew how much fast food I ate during my BP episodes lmao. I vent to him a lot Bc he always listen but tbh he rly doesn’t get it and idk if he can since he doesn’t have same Ed problems as me like when I talked abt struggling with staying ~FiT and HEaltHy~  during exams week he said basically to just *not binge* and *eat normal regular meals* like bitch don’t u think I know that???
Now I can’t fully blame him since I’m not being fully honest with him and am downplaying my symptoms a lot but damn it sucks that like he Lowkey just doesn’t get it and tbh most ppl in general just don’t get it. Ugh. I’m sick of living like this "

But ultimately you are the one to decide. Maybe try to see if you can get some experience in a research lab that does what you’re interested in (psychology) and if at all possible shadow a psychiatrist or see if u can talk to one to get to know what they do and then choose which one you think will be best for you

also was weirded out by how they took a dive into Supernatural mode by becoming obsessed with the weird ass symbols and the magic wand and they wentto the weird ""afterlife""????? or was it???? and the skull headed fuckface became the star of the show.

I was like, where are the royal families? Wheres the rest of the Wesen council (read: Alexander. I hope he is okay, We never actually know what happened to him)

Also, why isAdalind a softie now? i still like her but She lost her savage-ness

i feel like the writers highkey were trying to get us to accept Nadalind, tothe point that I wantedto not ship it lol. I dont hate it and itsbetter that Juliette x Nick (or Eve x Nick)

And i was so done with Sean's shit by then as well

​

also: Diana was OP to the fuckingmax. for a kid that arguably shoudnt have existed shes way too important

​

also why did she suddenly gang up with skul headed fuckface??

​

that final episode was fucking weird too. and theres nomore skull headed fuck face?? really really? for someone who is supposedly the devil or whatever, youd think hed maybe try to return

tbh I wasnt a bigfan of the Mirror traveling - eve beingsucked into death world - Skull headed fuckface plot tobegin with, which unfortunatly was majority of the season 6 plot. so im being really nit picky lol

the fact that they put the word christian in there is pisses me off because its misleading and I shouldnt be surprised but i hate that they would put the word christian in their name. its misleading and makes it sound like you can do/watch porn and serve christ which you cant. Is there any way we can get it removed?

btw, I believe i am right to be angry about it. it is a misuse of what christianity is about

christianity in a nutshell is about:

* serving God and God only. You absolutely can not serve God and porn at the same time. they are mutually exclusive. you just cant. hence they need to remove the title christian from their name

   * to serve God you should follow his commandment, which can be demonstrated by:

      * Loving God above all (ALL) other things, people, objects. Love him with every fiber of your being, with all of your soul
      * Love your neighbor as yourself

​

.Now you must go beyond just belief in God.

​

Now it is time to admit you are a sinner. that youre a bad person. (its ok bc everyone is a shitty person tbh).

​

then admit jesus is the Lord and that Jesus died for you. YOU!!!! because of your sins. he died as the perfect sacrifice to the lord. sacrifice in your place. he basically paid the tuition for you to get into Heaven.

​

now thank Jesus, the God of heaven Earth and the universe, for saving you and choosing you to have a place in heaven with him

​

Only through faith that Jesus died for you and raised from the dead so that you might be able to live and go toheaven. thats the way you will go to heaven

​

​

God bless you, i pray you do in fact take these next steps. because they are in fact very necessary. belief that God exists isnt enough, as even Satan knows that God is real. You have to also believe that Jesus died for you because humans are sinners that need him. "
