I am from southeast Asia (but my appearance doesn't represent SEA very well, only from the eyes and small nose), I have lost count on how many people wrongly guess where I am from and say, ""I thought you're Chinese.""

Most of them also assume that Asian people are Chinese. Only Chinese. I always try to educate them by telling the differences between Japanese, Korean, and China (ofc I can differentiate them) and China isn't the only country in Asia, but they always say Asians look the same.

One day I watched the old TV program from Japan, ""Humor Amarillo"" (for me this has racist connotation) or Takeshi Castle with my friends. The subtitle put the contestants as ""los chinos"". I told my friends that they were Japanese, not Chinese. ""Uf I don't know, I cannot see the difference.""

I cannot tell how much ignorant statements or judgements I have encountered here related to Asians, but at least when I explain, they are willing to listen. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject11,, 2021-11-13 11:30:33 , reddit post ," If you're going to go to Alhambra in the morning, you will need time to explore, around 3-4 hours would be enough. It's a huge place and you can explore a lot of things. Don't forget to buy the entrance in advance. Don't miss entering Palacio Nazaríes and Generalife.

Then, my recommendation to do in the afternoon: explore Sacromonte (the gypsy neighbourhood), walk through El paseo de los tristes, go to Mirador de San Nicolás (the good spot to take a look at Alhambra with the whole Granada, also if you want to take photo with the background of Alhambra), go to Mirador de San Cristóbal (this is my personal preference, this place is way cooler than the previous one. The perfect time to go here is before sunset, so you can enjoy the sunset with the view of Granada and Alhambra. Highly recommended).

If you want to explore the foods, definitely try to order drink (beers, etc.) and they will give you tapas. You can find them around Plaza de la Trinidad or Calle Elvira, they are the hotspots of bars and restaurants. If you want to go to the bars or pubs, there are several zones to visit: Calle Pedro Antonio de Alarcón, Plaza de los lobos (there's a place called Bohemia Jazz Café, it's cool).

Another thing, you definitely can explore the neighbourhood in the city because it has very particular style with Moorish influences. Also, you can visit or just take a look from outside of la catedral of Granada. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject11,, 2021-11-09 12:30:25 , reddit post ," I have visited both cities and in my opinion, Granada has so much more to offer. It has Alhambra as its main attraction, but the neighborhoods also have their own charms. For example, you can visit Sacromonte, the neighborhood of gypsies; their houses are based on caves. All those houses are painted in white. From there, you can also see the difference ambience between Alhambra and Sacromonte. Then, the foods. Visiting bars, enjoying the drinks and tapas are a must.

However, in Sevilla, there are several historical places that can't be missed. For example, Real Alcázar de Sevilla and Plaza de España. If you like certain movies and TV series that have used those places to shoot, maybe you're interested in visiting them. "

Nairobi and Bogotá were always put together since they stayed at the monastery. First, they were in the same team when they played football. They prepared for diving in the tank together. Then, they were also in charge of taking and melting the gold. I think they had more interaction ""before"" the heist, for example when she said that she wouldn't touch Bogotá with a ten-foot pole.

Then, I also noticed when Bogotá commented on her about wearing the scuba suit, apparently she didn't react very strong as usual (e.g. when she shouted at Palermo that he's a ""machista""). I don't know why, maybe she had a soft spot for him.

As we can see, the sparks became clear when Bogotá nursed Nairobi, also made her that ""motorcycle"". All of his attention belongs to Nairobi. Maybe after she confessed her feelings toward Helsinki and almost got killed -plus the flashback scene with Helsinki when they talked about love-, she realized that the person that Helsinki referred to was Bogotá.

Even though it was a little bit unclear and short, I like the relationships between them. Both have great work ethics. It broke my heart to watch the funeral scene, where Helsinki played the harmonica, then Bogotá stood at the same place where Nairobi got shot and the cracked window framed exactly at Bogotá's heart... That sequence was beautiful, by the way. "

Almost jeopardized my new residence permit for getting false information and not checking the website well. Found out that I could get a huge fine since I didn't apply for new residence card during the mentioned time. Waited for 1 month for the letter arrives at my house, but apparently I missed the document that was actually sent through the website. For a month.

I had panic attack. I was trembling, I didn't have sufficient energy to stand up when I talked about the problem I just discovered yesterday. I didn't have enough sleep last night because my brain couldn't stop thinking about this and imagining every worst possible ways of the consequences. Especially since I currently stay in another city and island, different from where I reside.

But thankfully today I have called the immigration office and apparently I have no problem. They won't fine me. I also already had the appointment for getting the new card next month. I did it yesterday and apparently if I did it today, I'd get the fastest appointment in March, which is a total nightmare.

I could not thank my family here enough for helping me and trying to calm me down. They give me very rational reasons to be patient, waiting for today to call the office since I discovered my huge problem yesterday in the evening.

And apparently I just found out that I got my period today. So basically yesterday was an insane combination of panic attack, PMS, and sleep deprivation.

I am strolling around the city, trying to relax a bit. Well, can't wait to arrive at home to get sleep. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject11, Should I [26F] confront a friend [25M] for not responding me several times? , 2020-01-06 21:11:33 , reddit post ," TLDR; A friend whom I had history with barely responded my text, I want to confront him what's going on and ask him whether he still wants to talk to me or not.

So I [26F] have known this guy [25M] for a year. We kinda had a history as friends with benefits. Since he's back with his girlfriend, working as a freelancer plus studying, we barely talk. We only met several times. I really don't mind if we don't talk as much as before, but honestly I am kinda upset with his response lately.

I sent him a Christmas greeting, he responded nicely but then when I asked him about his current final project of his study, he only read my text. But then NYE, I sent him another greeting. He also responded well, especially he remembered the things I've been through (July-November 2018 were extremely hard for me). Then I sent him text of thanking him for everything he has done to me, helping me through hard times, and showing me almost the entire island when I recently moved there. His next response? Nothing.

When we met for the last time in November, he told me how sorry he was when he forgot to respond my messages. He read it, but he forgot to reply because of work (and other factors that he didn't tell me but I knew it). ""I always told myself to reply your text, reply her text, reply her text, but then I got distracted again by work. I am so sorry,"" he said.

I still want to keep in touch with him because I consider him as a first good friend I know in this island, especially when I moved for the first time. We have good relationships. We already know each other well; we know each other's personal situations. He has helped me through some breakdowns I had during some difficult times (I live far away from my family and friends).

Also, as one of minor factors, having local friends in this island seems more difficult, based on my experience living in another city in the same country. To help with the cultural context, it's an island in a western Europe country.

For the record, I accidentally had feelings for him after 5 months, but at the same time he also confessed that he wanted to go back with her ex. BUT I don't have any intention of being in a romantic relationship with him. I only enjoy spending time with him, and that's it.

I know at some points, silence is an answer but I'd rather hear it from himself whether he still wants to talk to me or not.

Should I ask him what's wrong? If yes, what sentences are best to express my feelings and ask for his explanation?

At first I want to confront him by saying, ""Why don't you say anything to me? If I disturb you or don't want to talk to me anymore, it's better that you tell me right away."" I have asked a friend but she said it's too harsh/direct so I better modify the words a bit.

If I finally confront him, whatever his response is, I definitely would respect it.

Thank you in advance.

He just texted me. Seriously.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject11,, 2020-01-02 22:21:32 , reddit post ," Met several guys, 2 of them had great impacts on me. The 1st one we spent our time together for almost a year but now we don't talk too much because he's already back with his ex partner. But with him, he treated me well, he helped me through some breakdowns, and he made me realized that I actually deserved better things, since guys from my previous relationships had treated me awfully. I had an amazing time with him.

The 2nd, I thought I had found ""the one"". He thought the same. I learnt so much things from this situation; never ever get involved with someone too fast when you're still in the getting-to-know-each-other phase. I had complicated situation and he offered me to stay in his place. Since I had no other choice, I agreed. 2 weeks before I moved in, he suddenly freaked out and ended things between us, but I still moved in to his place because it's already a deal (I couldn't afford rent that time). Living with him for almost 2 months was a hell to me. It turned out to be the most toxic relationship I've ever had. He treated so bad, was mentally abusive by his words. Thankfully I could get out and never had any contact with him ever again. He's so manipulative.

Now I almost lose hope on meeting someone new through online dating app because I am actually tired to get to know someone again and again, plus some of them end up with ghosting each other. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject11, Why moving on is so hard? , 2019-12-16 00:06:49 , reddit post ," I [26F] am still reminiscing every moments I had with M [25M].

Yes, I had feelings for him, even though at the first time I knew him, I didn’t want to attach any feelings since what we did was casual. What we’ve done, for me and for him, were intimate but we are only friends. You know that kind of relationship.

When I met him for the first time, I didn’t expect that I could get along with him very well. All I knew, during our initial conversation, he seemed nice and friendly. But then, that first night changed everything.

The way he treated me, the way he listened to me... He has set the bar so fucking high.

I declared to myself that I didn’t want to ruin our relationship by having feelings towards him. At first I was confident enough to resist myself.

It took 5 months to finally I admitted that I unintentionally catched feelings for him. I told him.

My heart hurt so much when I saw the way he interacted with his ex-girlfriend when we went to a medieval festival together. I knew there’s something unfinished between them, especially I met him when they broke up for a couple of months. I burst into tears in secret that day. I called my friend, asking why it’s so hurt to see it. They didn’t do any stuffs like boyfriend and girlfriend, but my instincts were never wrong. I knew that he’s still in love with her.

At night, I confessed. It was rough. It took a great deal towards our relationship.

Then he revealed to me that he wanted to try to go back with his ex. That’s why when we took a time to sleep in his car before he dropped me off at my home then he went back to his house (1 hour driving), we didn’t do something that we usually did.

I cried so hard. My heart ached. My head was dizzy.
We didn’t talk much after that night. We didn’t meet for 2 month after that. All I knew was he went back to his ex-girlfriend.

To be frank, when I was with B [30M] during the absence of my relationship with M, I couldn’t forget about M. I secretly compared their treatments to me and the way they talked or argued with me. It’s bad, I know. Each of them has their own personal characteristics and I liked them, but there’s something I missed from M.

Last july, we met again. He said he missed me. Oh okay. I missed him, too. A lot. That night we ended up doing something we usually did, but just because we knew we had rough time and we were badly affected by our own situations.

Then in september before I left the city unexpectedly. That last night together with him was extremely sad yet memorable for me. It was possibly the best night ever with him. For the first time, we slow danced to the Nat King Cole’s songs. We went to eat mexican foods, followed by drinking a lot in the pub next to the restaurant. We were so drunk but we sang a lot together, we hugged and kissed, we really enjoyed our time together. It’s our ritual together. Again, he set the bar so damn high.

I know that he’s already with his girlfriend. They seem happy. They already have future plan together since their past-now-returning relationships.

But why it’s so hard for me to forget about him? I even don’t want him as a boyfriend, I see no future relationship with him, but I extremely enjoyed the thing we did together and the way he treated me. He helped me to realize that I deserve something beautiful and worthy.

We haven’t talked much since I know he’s busy with his job, study, and his girlfriend. But one day, in October, during a festival in the city where I lived next, I drunk-texted him, stated that I missed him. What a fool I was. But well, if I weren’t drunk I wouldn’t have the guts to tell him. He didn’t reply.

Of course, my move was absolutely garbage. I said “I miss you” to someone that already has girlfriend.

But again, he’s my partner in singing songs in the car. We have similar taste. We always sang together. It’s one of those things that I really miss to do with him. He’s the guy who listened to all my stories when I was overwhelmed with my previous job. He’s the guy who showed the island to me by going to almost every places I wanted to go from my list. He gave the sweetest, smoothest kisses.

I miss the moment when we went to our favorite bar, in our favorite spot (2nd floor, on the left table in front of the stairs); drinking beers, telling each other's stories even though he mostly heard mine, holding hands when we talked (I don't know why he always did that), kissing his forehead and hair also he's kissing my hands...

So please tell me, is there any way to move on? "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject11, I [26F] keep comparing guy's treatment to my previous experience with someone , 2019-12-08 19:50:56 , reddit post ," TLDR; I keep comparing the way some guys treat me when we hook up with my previous experience with someone that significantly influenced my preferences of treatment during sex.

So last night I [26F] hooked up with someone [28M] that I've known for 3 weeks, and there's something that bothers me a lot. Even though I enjoyed the sex, I can't help but comparing what he did to the things that I usually did with M [25M]. M is a ""friend"", we regularly had sex since January but we completely stopped since last November because he's back with his ex. Because of him, I am able to explore my own sexual preferences and the treatment that I like.

I really like what he did to me because he showed affection a lot during the time we did it. The guys I've hooked up with never did that to me, it's like whenever he finished he just said goodnight and slept facing the other side. With M, we always cuddled, I could sleep on his shoulder or his chest and he often hugged me. He also waited for me to finish (it takes a long time for this), followed my ""instructions"", and convinced me that the most important thing is we enjoy the moment; not only focusing to reach orgasm.

Basically he has set the bar so damn high for me to receive such treatment whenever I am intimate with someone. I also could sense when a guy is being selfish (only wants to satisfy himself), and of course my experience with M became one of the factors.

During June-July I was dating someone [30M] (period of M and I didn't meet because that's the time he told me he wanted to go back with his ex), I also unconsciously compared him to M, since I couldn't get the similar satisfaction I've had.

The guy from last night was kind, he always asked me what to do and to know if he hurt me or not. But again, the problem was I felt something missing when we're doing it even though I enjoyed it. We didn't finish last night but I felt bad because of this thought.

So I'd like to know, can I stop comparing what they do with my experiences with M? I know everyone is different in treating someone and it would be very selfish of me to compare them.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject11," Need advice, I keep comparing a guy's sex treatment to my previous experience with someone ", 2019-12-08 19:06:10 , reddit post ," TLDR; I keep comparing the way some guys treat me when we hook up with my previous experience with someone that significantly influenced my preferences of treatment during sex.

So last night I [26F] hooked up with someone [28M] that I've known for 3 weeks, and there's something that bothers me a lot. Even though I enjoyed the sex, I can't help but comparing what he did to the things that I usually did with M [25M]. M is a ""friend"", we regularly had sex since January but we completely stopped since last November because he's back with his ex. Because of him, I am able to explore my own sexual preferences and the treatment that I like.

I really like what he did to me because he showed affection a lot during the time we did it. The guys I've hooked up with never did that to me, it's like whenever he finished he just said goodnight and slept facing the other side. With M, we always cuddle, I could sleep on his shoulder or his chest and he often hugged me. He also waited for me to finish, followed my ""instructions"", and convinced me that the most important thing is we enjoy the moment; not only focusing to reach orgasm.

Basically he has set the bar so damn high for me to receive such treatment whenever I am intimate with someone. I also could sense when a guy is being selfish (only wants to satisfy himself), and of course my experience with M became one of the factors.

During June-July I was dating someone [30M] (period of M and I didn't meet because that's the time he told me he wanted to go back with his ex), I also unconsciously compared him to M, since I couldn't get the similar satisfaction I've had.

The guy from last night was kind, he always asked me what to do and to know if he hurt me or not. But again, the problem was I felt something missing when we're doing it even though I enjoyed it. We didn't finish last night but I felt bad because of this thought.

So I'd like to know, can I stop comparing what they do with my experiences with M? I know everyone is different in treating someone and it would be very selfish of me to compare them. Honestly I am afraid this would affect my personal judgment when I want to get to know someone and  it would screw up my future romantic relationship.

Thank you in advance. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject11, The concept of love , 2019-11-12 22:50:14 , reddit post ," When it comes to romantic love, I used to consider a person that makes me think, ""I like this person, we have something in common, we get along very well, he accepts me, and I want to be with him.""

As you can see, it's more like a possession. I craved the desire of having that person as romantic partner based on the things that I thought it'd perfect for us.

I recently learned something new about the concept of love. It feels and seems weird, to be honest. I was confused with what happened with my feelings and emotions.

I always avoid to admit such feelings I have as ""love"". It's too strong. For me, if I love someone, it means I am willing to dedicate everything I have for this person.

Apparently, this new concept of love teaches me selflessness. It teaches me that I can dedicate my feelings without hoping anything in return.

In my case, I don't feel the urge to make him as mine. I don't see any reason to make him feel the same to me.

I feel extremely comfortable with him. I trust him wholeheartedly.

After spending a day together on the first day we met, I declared to myself that I didn't want to ruin anything between us. It's too good. Ruining in this case means I'd have feelings for him. Well, it seemed that I failed.

Spending our spare time together, listening to music and singing along together, sharing each other's stories, drinking beers and vermouth as our rituals together are enough for me. It already makes me happy.

I really don't get it why I always feel so emotional every time I am with him. Suddenly I shed a tear when I kissed him in the forehead. I felt a weird sensation in my heart when I hugged him tight. I felt so comfortable every time he touched me and held my hands.

I also never expected I'd meet a person who could influence important aspect of my life. It's about self-worth; I deserve any beautiful things for myself.

But then, I see no future between us. Apart from my uncertain living condition in this country, his feelings are already dedicated to other person. He feels the thing that maybe similar with what I feel, but it's not for me.

Instead of being disappointed, I am happy if he can have similar feelings with any person that makes him genuinely happy and allows him to be true of himself.


(I wonder if you have experienced the same thing, or maybe you can explain what happened to me, because honestly I am not sure if the feelings that I have towards this person is love...) "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject11, I am mentally exhausted , 2019-11-11 00:33:56 , reddit post ," TLDR; This year is extremely challenging for my mental health.

It’s possibly the topic that I (26F) rarely speak about. I thought everything is fine. I thought I can handle everything. But when I had several breakdowns, I slowly realized that I do need to convince myself that “it’s okay not to be (always) okay”.

Maybe it started with my mindset about myself. It has two extreme views: it can assure myself that I can handle every situations I have, but the other side, it is probably the most toxic mindset I’ve ever had.

“I am different.”
“I am tough. I look tough.”

Such mentality has been stuck in my mind since I was a kid. I wasn’t afraid to fight everyone who mocked my physical appearance, for example my hair. I did things that usually girls in my environment didn’t have any interests in. For years I struggled to hide my insecurities about my body and my hair because they didn’t achieve the “social standards”. It took a lot of time to truly accept myself, no matter what people say about me.

That’s where my mindset came. I always think to see everything through the positive side, not only the negative side. I convince myself that “I am different and it’s great”. Also, “I am tough”, based on how I handled any cruel intentions from others.

I like that mindset about myself. It’s powerful for me. I never apologize to be who I am. Since I live abroad and independently, to be honest, I can live my life as I actually want. No need to hide anything, like I used to do before. This part, convincing myself that I am different and I am tough, I like it.

But when it comes to apply this mindset in my interpersonal life… That’s when I think I am fucked up.

To be frank, I like being seen (or judged, you name it) as a tough, strong girl. Apparently the self-concept I’ve made since I was little shaped my expectations towards people about myself. I don’t like to be seen as a weak person. I don’t want to show my vulnerable side (I only show them to my close friends).

I try to keep myself calm when I am in a bad situation, don’t want to show that I am so fucked up. I might be panic, and sometimes it shows, but I don’t wanna look weak.
That’s where I think that such concept is toxic for me.
Because I also think, “Others can handle similar situation well, why can’t I?” or, “I am strong, I am tough, I don’t want they see me like this.”

Not only that, I am also a person who is often optimistic. As I said before, I always try to see positive side more than the negative side, try to be neutral if there’re conflicts, convince myself that everything will be okay…

It actually leads me to mental state that isn’t healthy. I am blinded by such concept, it affects my mindset in maintaining relationships with certain persons. And it’s dangerous.
This year is the prove of everything. The dangerous side of my mindset. The turning point of my awareness towards my own mental and mind health. The uncontrollable situations that happened to me and the way I handled them.

This year is possibly hell for my mental and mind state. What I have been through, for fuck’s sake, how can I survive??
Doing a part-time job I’ve never done before, being so far away from family and close friends plus not be able to go home, living in a place where I had limited mobility, taking care of a child and teaching him english, thinking about my next step after finishing my study, thinking about how to earn more money to survive in a country where its living cost is much higher than in my country… All those things happened while I was working on my final project of my study, which took almost a year to finish.

When I lived in an island in Europe, I had difficulty to meet new people because of the mobility limitation I had. I was only able to go to the city center on the weekend. But then, I met some persons that influenced my life significantly.

Long story short, I learned a lot that nobody will understand me as much as I am and I won’t force it to them. Second, I met someone who helped me knowing myself more, that I deserve to receive anything beautiful, not only always having tough times. It’s surprising that I learnt it from another person, because I was already blinded with my mindset that I was the one who needs to struggle and fix everything. In short, I don’t give my own self a credit and also a break.

During that time, I had 2 breakdowns, where I went to a beach and slept in a hotel alone, drank beers and ciders, did a secret thing, cried a lot, felt ache in my entire body… I was really alone. I couldn’t tell anyone, even to my very close friend (I told her the other day), I asked the person who I knew I could rely on, but he couldn’t. I really hate such feelings.

Then the third, the fatal one… In short, I thought I have found something, trully being wanted by someone… But it turned out to be the most toxic relationship I ever had with someone. It also triggered the most toxic mindset I’ve ever had in an uncontrollable situation, when I was actually not the problem:

“I can fix this situation/problem.”
“It was my fault, I started that.”
“Everything is gonna be okay, I can change it.”

Even though I know the problem wasn’t coming from me. Even that person treated me so badly. Even that person blocked me for illogical reasons. Even that person has promised a lot of thing, but he’s the one who broke it. Even though I was the one who tried to calm everything down.
Then situation forced me to live with this person for 1,5 months. I didn’t have any choice. Guess what? I was treated awfully. This person was unbelievably mean to me; treated me like a trash. This person also told lies about myself to the others, but thankfully I had proves.

But I tried to handle it. I did. I convinced myself, “It’s okay, don’t worry. I only need to survive, don’t put my mind into it that much.”

During that time, my mental health was on the lowest point. I was looking for a job, I was struggling finding information about my visa, finishing final project for my study, having very limited economical resources, being brokenhearted for multiple times…

I kept it, I hid it, I only told my very close friends about my situation, lied to my parents… It cost me my own health.

I missed my period for 2 months. I lost weight, not in a healthy way. I smoked a lot (like, really), I drank a lot, I didn’t sleep very well. I was a mess. Maybe until now.
Now I am in the process of healing. Try to evaluate my mindset. Try to relax myself. Try to forget the awful treatment I’ve received in that toxic relationship. Try to keep myself busy with work.

See? That’s my other problem. I like being distracted. I like being busy by work or everything that I can do. I am so stressed out if I don’t do something. I like it because it doesn’t make me overthink (too much). Oh well, another toxic behavior that I have, I guess.

At this moment I really need to evaluate my mental health, to remind myself that I deserve a break, I deserve to be treated well, I deserve to change myself, not stick to the toxic mindset forever…

So, it’s okay that this time I am not strong or tough as usual. I am mentally exhausted. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject11,, 2019-11-09 14:48:05 , reddit post ," First, I really recommend you to do a research about the study you want to choose. There are some studies that have bilingual programs, some of them don't. Apart from the program itself, I think learn Spanish before coming to the country is necessary because based on my experience, it would help you to interact with local people because not all people here can understand English (well, depend on the location). Also when you process your documents here upon your arrival, every documents are mostly written in Spanish plus you gotta deal with the staffs (but luckily some of them are able to understand English).

For example, I am from Asia, I am a graduate student in Spain, I learnt Spanish only 6 months before I started my study (my study is 100% in Spanish and it requires minimum level of B2) and the process to understand Spanish in such short time was overwhelming. So that's why it's extremely important to know what program you'd choose and where the university is, so you can prepare your plan in the matter of learning Spanish. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject11, I wish I know what I feel. , 2019-05-14 16:00:47 , reddit post ," I even can't describe what I am feeling towards this person. The first person who made me realize that I deserve something beautiful.

I met this guy on tinder; he's the 4th person I met, and I was the 1st for him. After 2 weeks talking, we decided to meet. That day was amazing; we talked a lot, we're connected at so many things, until we sang along in his car until we forgot to leave the car. That night we ended up having sex, but that's the moment when I realized I deserved something beautiful. My experiences with my previous boyfriends and ex-friends with benefits were not really nice. Then came this guy, changed my perspectives about myself and my sexuality. That's just the 1st day we met. I also couldn't forget his kisses, just exactly what I wanted; soft and slowly.

Since that day, we usually meet each weekend. I work during the week, and he studies also works. Since I am new to the island (I moved to an island in Spain since January, but already live in this country since 2 years ago to study), we regularly went to places I want to visit. He accompanied me each weekends and I couldn't be more happier.

It's been 5 months we're doing this; meeting each weekends, do our things (visit new places, eat and drink, lay down on a park or beach, talk about anything or personal stuffs, and have sex). He also doesn't hesitate to pick me up and drive me back to my house, even though he lives a little bit far from my house. He also came to visit me when I had the worst breakdown during my time here, which happened last week. I asked him to come to a place near his neighborhood. He spent 3 hours with me during the day that he already had plans with his friends, just to calm me down and accompany me.

I'd say what I am doing with him is literally better than any relationships I had. At this point, we already shared our very personal stuffs to each other; for example, he told me that he's bi, he introduced me to his best friends and we already hung out for several times together, his first ex partner even wanted to meet me since they're still keeping in touch, until I met his last ex yesterday in an event. I couldn't count how many personal stuffs of mine I've told him, but I can make sure that I am so comfortable with him and I am glad that he can trust me that way. With him also, I became more confident in exploring my preferences of my sexuality.

Speaking about relationships, this is complicated. I don't know what I feel towards him, but what I do know is I really care for him, I don't want to ruin anything with him; the things that happen between us is already making me so happy. He broke up months ago and he's always been in  long term relationships. He told me he wants to take a break from relationships, but he told me he likes what we have now and we agree to get to know each other more. On the other side, I also have some fears of getting into an exclusive relationship because I've been single for 8 years and had horrible break up before.

My close friends are glad that I finally can meet a nice guy like him, but they also warned me to be careful; there's possibility that I'd fall in love with him, plus the circumstances won't support it.

It's almost July, I will finish my job here soon and I also will finish my study. I become more nervous, I want to stay here more, but I have to find another job here. The uncertainty of staying in this island also makes me afraid of losing him, actually.

I am too comfortable with him. I talked to some guys and they asked me to meet, but I kept postponing it because I chose to spend my time with him.

What am I feeling towards him? I really don't want to ruin things between me and him. I like what we have now, but at the same time I am afraid; my future in this place is unclear. Maybe it's gonna break my heart if finally I don't get any job here and I should go back to my country. I can't emphasize enough that I've never felt so happy for a long time like this. "

September 2017, moved to Jaén to study and I was shocked listening to the Andalusian accent. I really wanted to cry when I spoke to anyone there because I couldn't understand them very well. Two years later, I feel overwhelmed yet lucky that I had experience practicing more Spanish in Jaén because Andalusian accent (plus the culture and the people!) grows on me very well. At least I can understand other region's accent easier, since I consider Andalusian is the hardest one. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject11,, 2019-05-02 23:30:04 , reddit post ," At first I didn't want to try it, but I was so curious I read some articles on how to do it and how good it is. After having pregnancy scare for 2 weeks and finally I got my period, I talked to my guy about having sex when I have my period. We discussed it and we thought that we needed more time to get to know each other's sex preferences (because we just knew each other for 3 months).

But boy, I can't deny that during period, I am hornier than usual. I met him on the 2nd day and it's the wildest day for my period because I bled the most on that day. We went to a beach, and we found a spot where there's no one there between the bushes, we started to make out and did blow job to him. I am a person who is still new to sex (I've been sexually active for 1 year), and I am still shy to do new things. This day, it was completely different. Maybe because of the high libido from period and also relief from pregnancy scare, I went wild.

When we went back to the hotel, we continued our make out session, until the part that we couldn't hold it any longer. He asked me to go with him to the bathroom, and we had sex there. I sat near the sink while he was fucking me. So, what did it feel?

It's was surprisingly great! I didn't need additional lubricant thanks to the blood. I didn't feel any pain when we had sex. Sometimes I can handle the pain, sometimes all I can do is laying down on the bed. I'd say that the sex helped me to ease the pain. Even though I didn't get the climax, I did enjoy the period sex. The result was also wild, tho. We were surprised how many blood was dripping on the floor, and our bodies (plus his hands) looked like we're escaping from a crime scene, hahaha.

But this is absolutely a personal preference, because some of us surely will be disgusted by the blood, can't handle the period pain so it will be difficult to have sex, or other reasons. You might enjoy it or dislike it at all. "

We had sex that night and it was fun, I was the one who had the orgasms, but he didn't. We decided to sleep after that. We're always naked while sleeping together.

I didn't know how long we've been sleeping, but all of sudden he moved roughly, starting to masturbate and kiss me wildly! At that time I was still sleeping but when he started kissing me, I was like, ""Huh? Oh okay,"" and followed his lead, hahaha.

We did that until he finally came on my stomach, and we started to laugh, like, what the hell was going on?? He told me, ""I don't why, all of sudden I am horny as fuck."" Then we quickly went to sleep again. In the morning, we talked about it again in a better state (already woke up) and we couldn't hold our laughter because we found it so hilarious.

But I don't know, is it common that a guy feels extremely horny while sleeping then masturbates consciously or even unconsciously? "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject11, When a 5 year-old kid hurt you by his words , 2019-05-02 00:46:04 , reddit post ," I was helping a 5 year-old boy to change his pajamas before he went to sleep. He looked upset because his mom is out of town until Monday to visit her mother and some friends. I asked him nicely to take his t-shirt off to change to his pajamas.

(We speak in spanish)
""I miss my mom!""
""Yes I know. Can you change your clothes, please?""

He said that for several times and I was confused, I know he misses his mom but nothing I could do to bring her mom back. I only asked him to change his clothes until...

""I miss my mom! You don't understand!""

I could feel that my expression changed. I couldn't say anything, but I felt something hurt. Kid, you don't know how much I understand such situation.

It also surprised me how a 5 year-old kid could say something that felt like he stabbed me in the heart.

I haven't seen my mom for 2 years since I moved to Spain to continue my study, and now I work as au pair meanwhile I finish my final work of my study. I am from Asia and it's so freaking far away from Spain, about 13000km distance. Been living with the family for 4 months.

I could have said that to the kid right away, but I hold myself. To be honest, I almost cried.

I really wanted to say, ""You know what? I understand! Why? I haven't seen my mom for 2 years! Can you imagine not to be able to talk in person with her, to eat sushi with her because it's our thing together, and to hug her?? I totally understand, but I survive! I try to be strong everyday! Even though now we're going to extremely different way of life (my mom is getting more conservative meanwhile I already quit practicing the religion, plus I got tattoo without her knowledge), I am sure you can't imagine living alone in another country, trying to survive and live better while each day you miss your parents.""

His father came to his room because he's crying. He gave him a short speech on how to deal with such situation that he should be happy for her mother, too because she's having her great time now. Her mother actually doesn't travel so frequently, only 2 times since I live there and it's always for the same purpose. That time, I tried not to be too emotional. Then I went to the bathroom, tried to calm myself.

I didn't say any word, I only listened to him that he misses his mom. I actually have a commitment to myself that I will never ever compare other's sadness with mine when someone tells me something. To tell that I can't see my mom for 2 years to that kid just to make him stop whining would have been the most selfish thing I've ever done.

I simply listened, even though deep down I felt hurt. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject11,, 2019-04-01 23:12:43 , reddit post ," Yesterday, I finally had the chance to explore more my interests in sexual activities. So I am seeing this guy for three months and I know that he practices BDSM. Since the beginning we never did anything rough when having sex, but since I am still exploring what I like (and I never get orgasm through penetrative sex), I told him my desire to try BDSM.

Before I met him yesterday, I've browsed any information about it, and some reddit users here gave me great advices on how to begin. For example, to make a list of kinks I want and don't want to try.

During the day, we did our things together [laying down on the sand/rock and listening to music], but it ended up with outdoor (oral) sex near a beach in the afternoon, where there was no one around and we really had great time.

At night, I showed him the list of kinks I'd like to try and he seemed excited that I had the time to find information and make the list. Oh boy, the sex was amazing and we did it twice and lasted for hours. I could get an orgasm after long time playing around and masturbating in front of him. Still not from penetrative sex, but finally I could get orgasm when I was with a partner.

That was also the first time I tried period sex. When we discussed it at the beach, we both thought to do it in another way when we already know each other's sexual interests much better. But you know what? We finally did it that night. It felt amazing and it did relieve the pain, even though at the end our bathroom looked like a crime scene that was full of blood (2nd day of period, it was a madness).

I never thought that biting on the neck and other body parts really turned me on. I am huge fan of teasing, and I teased him so bad until I could see how powerful he was when he played his role as dom. Scratching the back, hair pulling, spanking, and also felt great for me!

So, I am happy that I finally have more chance to explore my sexual activities. I am also glad that I can do this with a person that isn't selfish (compared to my previous exes) and able to help me exploring my interests. Can't wait to try more things!

So far I know that he's a switch but mostly dom, he likes soft spanking, ropes, collar, and wax. I am still lack of sex experiences, but to be honest I am interested in trying BDSM. I've read several articles and subreddit here, but I still need more explanation and advices.

I've talked about this to him that I'd like to do more than the ""regular"" sex we have; we usually do foreplay, oral sex, and penetration (but I never reach the climax, neither does he. He told me it's also hard for him). A little bit background story, I became sexually active since last year. I am not sure if this is a problem that comes from myself or I haven't explored many things yet, I never have orgasm with penetrative sex, but I can have it when I masturbate.

He told me he still needs to know me and ""my limit"". Well, I even don't know my limit since I never have such experience before; that's why I want to try. But can you explain to me more about the limitation in the BDSM, especially when I am totally clueless about my own limit?

He also told me that he worries that on some points he might can't control himself when he becomes the dom. He said that sometimes he can be very rough, like pulling hair, biting, etc. I still have no idea how things might go if he said so, but I'm so curious to explore new things with him, since this is the first time I have sex with a guy who is selfless and truly gives me pleasure; this guy gives me huge impacts on my perspective about sex and self-worth.

Some things that I do know about my preferences are I love teasing, I like to get more stimulation at my boobs, and I like that he penetrates me deeply. Then the thing I'd like to try first is to be blindfolded, spanked, and choked. I realized when we had sex for several times, he unintentionally chocked me softly and actually I kinda like it. "

Then as the time goes by, I also realize that sex life is about exploring, and I'd love to know more, especially about my preferences. And as you said, being safe and having fun are my top priorities. Thank you for your comment :) "

And yes, I think we need to talk about the boundaries soon when we meet because we just had this conversation yesterday. Thank you for your comment! "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject11, I [25F] am still exploring my sex life , 2019-03-26 00:20:55 , reddit post ," I [25F] am still in the process of exploring my sex life because I'm still new to this; I became sexually active since last year. I am not sure if this is a problem that comes from myself or I haven't explored many things yet, I never have orgasm with penetrative sex, but I can have it when I masturbate.

Related to that, I am currently seeing a guy who is included in the BDSM community. So far I know that he's a switch but mostly dom, he likes soft spanking, ropes, collar, and wax. I am still lack of sex experiences, but to be honest I am interested in trying BDSM. I've read several articles and subreddit here, but I still need more explanation and advices.

I've talked about this to him that I'd like to do more than the ""regular"" sex we have; we usually do foreplay, oral sex, and penetration (but I never reach the climax, neither does he. He told me it's also hard for him). He told me he still needs to know me and ""my limit"". Well, I even don't know my limit since I never have such experience before; that's why I want to try. But can you explain to me more about the limitation in the BDSM, especially when I am totally clueless about my own limit?
