It might be a bit awkward, but then again it’s an awkward situation. Honestly it sounds like a really annoying thing to deal with. I’d probably be in the same non-confrontational boat as you seem to be, ha.

Even if it makes things tense for a little while, I’d still just tell her. If you don’t you’re only going to be more and more pissed off around this person, which isn’t good either. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject8,, 2021-11-19 03:50:38 , reddit post ," If a kid is well behaved by toddler standards, there’s no problem at all.

As others have said, to me that basically means:

- No running around the restaurant (if it’s slow and they’re calm, I’m personally ok with a hand-held walk if they have itchy feet).

- No screaming/tantrums. Hungry kids get fussy but if the volume goes up and stays up, it’s time to leave/take them outside until they calm down. I try to bring out something simple for kids to snack on if I can, but it may be a good idea to pack some snacks yourself. Also colouring books or an iPad or whatever.

- Kids are messy and I don’t expect you to pick up every Cheerio off the table/floor (part of going out with kids is not having to deal with the mess afterwards lol), but please put in a little effort to tidy things up, especially if they do make a big mess.

- Pick a time that’s a bit earlier than normal for lunch/dinner. Say 11 for lunch, or 5 for dinner. Not a big deal but we can usually have your food out quicker and give you more attention when it’s less busy. Plus then if the kids start acting up you’ll be out of there by the time the restaurant fills up.

You deserve a break! I encourage all moms/dads to take a load off and go out to eat. Enjoy yourself :) "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject8,, 2021-11-17 23:53:00 , reddit post ," Management is really picky when it comes to hiring. They emphasize personality over skill, so we’ve had quite a number of servers do trial shifts and not work out, not because they were bad at the job, but because they didn’t seem to gel with the group or even want to. (Not sure how I got hired actually— I’m quite shy before I get comfortable in my environment.)

Anyway, I think this has a lot to do with it. We have good people right from the start. But there *are* ups and downs like anywhere else, and I’ve also worked at places with a less than great employee atmosphere.

The two rules I set for myself are:

- No talking behind anyone’s back, like ever. Doesn’t do any good, and just helps create an untrusting/negative atmosphere, even if the person “deserves” it. If someone else starts doing it, just listen, but don’t say anything committal. Remember that they’re also not “bad” for engaging in it, they’re likely blowing off steam.

- Be kind and helpful. It’s dorky but I often try to be the change I want to see, even if it’s only at my serving job. There’s a caveat for people who’d take advantage of this attitude though— set boundaries for yourself when it comes to slacker coworkers, etc.

Neither of these are really “special”, and you’ve definitely heard them before. I will say that I do like bringing in little surprises for my coworkers from time to time, I suppose. Homemade cookies or drawings. I like to doodle on their memo pads sometimes too. Buy them a beer if we’re closing together, lend out my umbrella if they’re walking home in the rain, whatever. It feels good to just be a pal. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject8,, 2021-11-17 21:31:02 , reddit post ," I really like them. Funny, kind, hardworking people. Fun to talk to and there to support you if you need it. I’ve only been at my place since the summer but my coworkers are one of my favourite parts of this job. The team atmosphere is honestly why I stick around, because I know I could be making more money somewhere else. But I’d rather enjoy being at work than hate it and bring home more tips, personally. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject8,, 2021-11-17 02:14:41 , reddit post ," The idea is if your meal is good, it shouldn’t be “work” to eat it. Or like, it’s not a chore you’re doing. A lot of people hate it.

I get why they don’t like it, but that attitude reminds me of getting upset when people say “no problem” instead of “you’re welcome”. "

It was actually kind of scary, considering I was a healthy weight to begin with for 5’6. All the exercise plus not so much time to eat/cook.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject8,, 2021-11-09 12:38:20 , reddit post ," Hey there! First off, you’re right. I didn’t mean it to, but that definitely came off as dismissive, and I apologize. I don’t want to trivialize anyone for choosing to avoid things like bone-char, palm oil, or any of the other foods that can be real points of contention within the vegan community.

“Essentially meaningless” is a loaded phrase, and again, I could have worded it more thoughtfully. But I guess it’s the difference between where you and I draw the line between a reasonable and unreasonable effort to reduce animal suffering. It’s not so much that I see the effort in avoiding refined sugar as too great, but rather that the effect it has on directly contributing to animal suffering is very slight. One can definitely make the argument that no amount is too “slight”, but again, it’s where do you draw the line? I know you probably hate as much as I do when people make the point that mice and insects are killed in the process of grain and vegetable harvesting, but I don’t avoid bread. I don’t always buy organic vegetables from the farmer’s market or grow my own backyard carrots.

Basically, I just want to say I think it’s great to avoid refined sugar if you want to, and keep fighting the vegan fight. "

Lol no one asked you, nerd "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject8, Crazy lady tries her darnedest to crash our staff meeting , 2021-11-09 11:39:11 , reddit post ," The other day our sweet little restaurant closed for a few hours in the afternoon for a boh/foh staff meeting. Doors locked, open sign flipped to closed, and a notice taped to the door explaining the situation, how long we’ll be closed, and apologizing for the inconvenience.

We’re about 30 minutes in when I see in the corner of my eye someone drifting around by the door. It’s been happening— people arriving, reading the notice, and leaving. I watch them as they process what’s going on, looking inside to see a big circle of us all sitting there. No one’s actually tried the door yet, somehow— taking all the evidence before them as true that we are indeed closed. Only at this point, I see the woman who’d caught my eye pull on the door.

“Do you think if we put up another sign she’d read that one?” someone says and we laugh. I wonder if my manager will get up to go talk to the woman outside, but she laughs too and continues on with the agenda. My manager can’t see, but I can, that by now the woman is waving her arms, trying to grab our attention. She taps on the glass door. “Really?” sighs my manager. “Just don’t make eye contact guys.”

The woman continues to be a moderate distraction for a short while before seemingly admitting defeat. Not five minutes later, however, back she is. Hammering on the glass with her fist, yanking on the door handle. Tapping so much I have new appreciation for the life of aquarium fish. This woman is hopping mad. She does everything but shake her fist at us— and she might have even done that too, it was hard to tell.

More muttering from my manager and coworkers at the persistence and stupidity of this woman. By this point it might have made more sense to just go talk with her to tell her to leave (or maybe that would have just made things worse), but we were committed, and she couldn’t hang around for that much longer, right?

I have to pause the story briefly to introduce a new element. I’d opened that day, and had had a couple of campers enjoying our frigid patio. A really nice two top. They’d already settled up, so I just swung by to let them know a staff meeting would be starting and service would stop. They were more than welcome, however, to stay and chat, and could exit through the gate, as we’d be locking our patio door. They thanked me for letting them know, and joked they didn’t mind that I wouldn’t be serving them, that they were just glad we weren’t kicking them out.

Cut back to the staff meeting. The woman has abandoned the front entrance, but I can see through the glass doors onto our patio that she’s now there instead, leaning over the fence, evidently talking to the two top. And this sixty-something woman is having a full on meltdown. Flapping her arms, shaking her fists, and possibly screaming (a nice time to have sound resistant glass— or it would be, if I weren’t so curious to hear how that conversation played out.) She doesn’t leave for a full five minutes, just bitching about us to this poor table. My manager has no clue this is happening, as it’s all directly behind her. Had she known, she probably would have by now done something about it. But I’m too in awe at the lunacy of the situation to do much more than watch it unfold. A few more angry gesticulations, and finally, I see her get in her car and speed away through a stop sign.

I wish I could say I got a recap of their conversation, but the two top left just before the meeting was over. My manager shook her head at the thought of the one star review everyone agreed we were bound to be receiving shortly.

I don’t understand people. I really don’t. Did she not read the notice? See the sandwich board inside? See the closed sign? And if not, was she not tipped off by the fact that despite her obviously audible door-banging, no one was going to let her in? Not only are we closed, which means you won’t be able to order food, we are also, as per the notice, in the middle of a meeting! Which means we cannot pause to talk to customers to tell them that yes, *we are closed*, and no, they can’t just get something “to-go”!

Just bizarre. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject8,, 2021-11-09 10:20:41 , reddit post ," I hit them up with something like “Hey, just to let you guys know, we do close at 10pm, which is in about 15 minutes. You’re more than welcome to stay and chat while I start closing things down, but I’m just going to grab your bill for you now so we can settle up.”

Obviously every place has its own policy, but if you can, being polite but direct (i.e. telling, not asking, what’s going to happen) is best. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject8,, 2021-11-09 08:23:39 , reddit post , You take yours off?? Lol 
eRisk2022-T3_Subject8,, 2021-11-09 04:39:51 , reddit post ," That is seriously annoying.

Full disclosure— I’m vegan, so I think I can understand maybe why this person is asking this: sometimes sugar is filtered with bone char, so if a soda is made with sugar instead of corn syrup, there’s a reasonable chance it’s not “technically” vegan. Many vegans though (including myself) think that’s a lot of effort to make for something with an impact so small it’s essentially meaningless. Not to mention it’s a waste of the server’s time when you could just order something you *know* doesn’t have sugar in it, if you care that much about some by-product of the animal agriculture industry anyway.

Oh yeah, milk is sometimes in Asian soft drinks too. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject8,, 2021-11-07 23:31:13 , reddit post ," This is a great question.

First off, it might be a good idea to ask if something is spicy **before** ordering, if the item looks like there’s even a remote chance it might have heat to it. I get this question a lot from customers and it’s not a problem at all to answer for them. Same goes with asking if it has aioli on it. Doesn’t hurt to double check.

Secondly, it’s actually pretty stressful when someone leaves their food completely untouched. If there’s a full plate left by the end of your meal, every half decent server can tell something wasn’t right. It’s stressful because we basically don’t know what’s up— what was wrong with the dish, or what’s going through the guest’s head. So when we ask how things are, speak up! Sometimes customers just don’t want to be a bother, but most of the time they’re upset in some way and expect us to mind-read. Only by the time the bill comes, there’s not much we can do beyond comping the meal (which often isn’t “enough” for some people.)

When I come by to ask how things are, I genuinely want to know (especially if it’s inedible!!) I don’t like it either when guests aren’t enjoying their food. And when they’re polite about it, I don’t have a problem at all trying to make it right— whether that’s remaking the dish, getting you an alternative, or comping it. I don’t find it Karen-y to truly not like your meal. It happens. And I can always tell the difference between someone who is trying to be polite and considerate, and someone who is an asshole or trying to scam free food. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject8,, 2021-10-26 10:56:11 , reddit post ," I’ve tried the whole finger tips thing and it isn’t for me. I use my palm and kind of rest the tray on my forearm, in the non-dominant hand. Do what works for you though. But you should definitely place heavier drinks in the centre so when you’re lifting drinks off the tray it doesn’t become unbalanced. You can also shift drinks around on the tray as you need to when handing them out to guests. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject8,, 2021-10-22 22:27:07 , reddit post , Sometimes just being a good example is more or as persuasive as actively trying to “convert” friends and family. Different methods work better or worse for different people.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject8,, 2021-09-20 00:04:48 , reddit post ," My ex had been vegetarian for many years before going back to omni just before we started dating (they had an eating disorder and wanted to prioritize their mental health for the time being.) But, they had no problem at all eating my vegan cooking and only going to restaurants with decent vegan options. It worked out pretty well. The only thing I didn’t like was having the occasional bits of dairy or jerky in my apartment.

I think if a partner is happy knowing they’re only going to be eating vegan food at home (I like being the cook most of the time), I don’t mind so much if they choose to eat omni when we eat out. I rule out any diehard meat fans, but am ok I suppose with flexitarian types.

Although of course I’d prefer it if they were also vegan or at least vegetarian, it’s not a deal breaker for me. There’s a lot of social and political issues to spend your energy on, and this one happens to be mine. So I do try to not judge other people too much for not being vegan, even a partner (I’m not perfect though— I definitely do judge a little.) The only stipulation would be that they’d have to be ok with raising any potential future kids as vegan. "

I was wondering what your thoughts are regarding leather. Is it better to purchase (preferably thrifted) leather goods than new vegan leather equivalents? I’m thinking of the environmental impact of resource extraction for the plastic/other materials as well as the long time it takes for such vegan leather products to break down.

Is all or most leather a by-product of the meat industry? I don’t know. If it is, do you think it’s better to not “waste it”, or to curb the demand and therefore incentive of cattle rearing?

I haven’t really made my mind up on this one so I’d be interested to know.

Thanks! "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject8,, 2019-09-30 19:10:20 , reddit post ," If they don’t know you’re vegetarian, let them know. They might offer to make you something special. If they don’t, tell them you’ll be bringing your own main course. Preferably this will already have been cooked by you at home, so the only thing you might have to do at your boyfriend’s house is reheat it.

I say tell them, as asking if you should bring your own main course is usually a little awkward. If they haven’t already offered to provide food for you, asking them if you should bring your own food points that out. And then they feel like you think they’re rude, or they feel they’re expected to accommodate when they don’t really want too... it’s just weird.

They might then offer to make you special food once you tell them you’ll be bringing your own though, and that’s ok. You can let them. "
