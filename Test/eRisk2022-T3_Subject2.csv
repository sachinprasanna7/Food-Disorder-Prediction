The poor techs at her last appt did not expect it. I told them she’s a bit spicy but she’s so tiny and pathetic looking (and she was snuggled up in my arms because she was scared and she trusts me but honestly even though she looks cute when she does that I feel like that should be taken as a sign that she doesn’t feel safe and is likely to be quick to defend herself if you mess with her) anyway, they were like we’ll see. And they saw. My sister’s cat is the complete opposite. She’s large. Just a huge frame. But she’s so polite and gentle and outgoing. Gentle giant vs cantankerous smol bean. "

Like a backyard or even a porch where you could work on recall with him outside but not at the park? See if maybe a different outdoor environment might be a bit of a middle ground.

Also, I checked the rabbitgoo harness on google and it looks less secure than the Kitty Holster. The Kitty Holster is really strong velcro so it kind of hugs the cat around the waist and doesn’t give much wiggle room for escape. Same thing around the neck except its stiff fabric and it seems to be at a different place on the neck than most harnesses so its harder for them to slip out.

If he was able to slip out you might want to look into a different harness. I recommend the Kitty Holster harness. If you put it on properly it is difficult for even the most wiggly cat to escape.

For the running, is he running away because he is overwhelmed or anxious? Is he running to catch things and explore? Maybe work on using treats to sort of train him to respond to his name. It can take a lot of practice. You can check out cat.school on instagram for some tips.

Another thing, if he’s anxious or overstimulated outside is to provide a place for him to feel safe and secure. When I go on walks I always bring a cat backpack carrier for my cat to hop into whenever she wants. It really helps calm her down. "

They’d get mad at me for not grabbing enough food and then get mad at me for grabbing more food than I could eat. I couldn’t win. Not to mention they never bought food I liked and would have to force the food down as I was gagging.

Unfortunately, I didn’t realize how wrong that was until I was an adult. My parents were horrified when I told them.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject2,, 2021-09-29 20:00:47 , reddit post ," My routine:

I’m a lifeguard and swim teacher so I’m in the pool more than is good for my hair so I’ve ended up having to clarify my hair far more than I should. I’m in the pool at least once a week, sometimes more so I do use a clarifying shampoo at least once a week because the chlorine seems to make my hair worse than clarifying less frequently. Occupational hazards lol.

Anyway,

- every time I’m in the pool I wash my hair with Paul Mitchel Shampoo 3. I know its quite harsh but its what I’ve found gets the chlorine out the best.

- I follow with either Shea Moisture Restorative Conditioner or Shea Moisture Intensive Hydration Conditioner. I know Shea Moisture can be quite heavy for some hair but these two conditioners made my hair softer and even curlier than before. I’ve tried their other conditioners and I’m not a fan.

- I use a wet brush to brush the conditioner through my hair. It worked wonders when my hair was longer. I’m not sure if I need to change up my technique now or if it just works better on longer hair.

- I rinse out the conditioner with cool or cold water and spray in Shea Moisture’s coconut oil leave in while I’m still in the shower and brush it through my hair with my wet brush. Sometimes I add Shea Moisture’s Smoothie and/or Frizz Free Mousse. Sometimes I don’t. It takes me a bit longer to do my hair when I use them so if I’m in a hurry I’ll skip it. Then I’ll use praying hands to apply The Ordinary’s Marula Oil or Chia Seed Oil and then brush it through with my Wet Brush. Throughout this process I have my shower on the misting setting and I re-wet my hair as needed.

- I put my hair in a shower cap for the rest of the shower and let it air dry when I get out. I’ve tried diffusing and plopping and both always leave me with frizz. I’ve tried finger coiling and I don’t think I have the coordination or patience unless I’m doing it wrong. Usually air drying leaves me with the best results.


On days I need a refresh and I haven’t been in the pool, I do a cowash with one of my Shea Moisture conditioners watered down.

About once a month I’ll rinse my hair with ACV. It seems to make my hair more manageable. I’ll follow with a deep conditioning mask. I still haven’t figured out what deep conditioning mask to stick with yet. "

It would get replaced by the YMCA. I’ve worked there, the community center is still a better place to work. And it has much more of a community.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject2,, 2021-09-16 18:46:35 , reddit post ," My job needs to learn this. We are shutting down facilities because we literally can’t staff them. We can’t offer programs we used to because we don’t have the staff.

But apparently we can’t raise wages until we start bringing in more revenue. Which we won’t be able to do until we have more staff to keep the facilities open and staff the programs. These programs have historically  brought in significantly more revenue to the company than literally anything else.

They can’t take a short term loss or pay higher ups slightly less just to increase wages so we can get staff so we can run these programs and operate the facilities which would 100% bring in more revenue.

I’m no expert in business or economy, I literally took two 100 level econ courses at community college and thats it but I’m pretty sure this is just how things work under capitalism.

My job likes to use the fact that they are a non profit and that my department mostly hires high schoolers as an excuse to not pay living wages and thats complete bullshit. Just because 60% of our staff is high schoolers and live at home doesn’t mean they don’t deserve to be fairly compensated for their work. "

Why are there a half dozen cosmetic gynecologists in my area and no endo specialists? Its absurd. 
eRisk2022-T3_Subject2, I’m so tired. Of all of this. And I’m just plain tired too. , 2021-09-12 00:46:47 , reddit post ," I went to bed around 11pm last night cause I was so tired and I woke up at almost noon. I slept great. But I’ve been tired all day. Not groggy, like a full body exhaustion. I woke up in pain cause I had to pee. Thats a new thing, pain when my bladder fills up. Sometimes its so bad I lose the “need to pee” feeling and all I feel is pain.

I started to feel like I was getting sick yesterday. I was achy and my taste was off. I was out sick from work for over a week and just got back to work two weeks ago. Then last weekend I had an endo flare up and the pain just never entirely went away. Usually the pain lasts a few days and is gone in a week at most for me. It was a week yesterday since the flare up last weekend and it actually feels worse today than it has all week. I’m so frustrated.

I’m not even officially dxed. My primary care doctor and I both think I have it but she can’t do a lap. We thought it might be GI for a while and were heading down that path until covid hit and all my specialist appts were cancelled. Over the past year and a half my symptoms got worse and started pointing more towards endo.

I had to switch gynos because mine moved out of state. I was seeing the nurse at my old gyn’s office but I don’t even like the nurse and the office is so out of the way. The other doctors at that office mainly do obstetrics and aren’t accepting new patients. So I had to find a new office. I finally called and made an appointment last week. The soonest I could get in with a new one is the end of October. I don’t even know if I’m going to like this new doctor or if they know much about endo anyway. If this doctor doesn’t work out it’ll be another 2 month wait to get in to see another new doctor.

I’m just so tired of being tired and in pain and having to wait to see a new doctor that might not even work out before I can even do anything about it. And now I’m getting sick like at least once a month on top of the whole suspected endo thing. I just can’t catch a break. And it feels like its just getting worse.

I just hate feeling like shit all the time. I hate still feeling like shit even on my “good” days. I hate being exhausted all the time. I hate being in pain. I just want to live my life. I’m tired of sleeping 12 hours a day just to wake up fatigued and achy every day. I’m tired of not being able to make plans because I don’t know if I will be able to do things or if I will be too exhausted and in too much pain to even get out of bed. "

Provided there is nobody else around. They can find the outdoors a bit overstimulating at times and people tend to be very loud. I bring a backpack carrier with me for them to hide in if they get overstimulated.

I also put their harness on to take them to explore the forbidden parts of the house aka the attic and the basement. We don’t give them free access to those places so of course they find those places extra exciting. Its a special treat for them to get to explore on a leash. And it makes them less likely to just sneak in because they know that beyond certain doors they must be wearing their harness.

Another fun thing to do is teaching them tricks. I’ve got a clicker training stick and I’ve taught my cats High Five, Touch (aka they boop the stick with their nose), and Spin. My one cat particularly likes Learning and I’m working on getting her to ring one of those [button bells](link).

Also qtips are pretty big around here and those wool dryer balls. And a box filled with that brown crinkly packing paper. Just order some stuff off chewy dot com and and keep the box and packing paper. No need to get a fancy bed or anything, they’ll prefer the box.

You could also get a collapsible tunnel for some fun zoomies. My cats love to chase each other through the tunnel.

And finally, just let some big, juicy flies into the house. Those are the best toys. They’ll go crazy for some flies. And if you’re (un)lucky they might even gift them to you (in your bed) after they’re done with them.

Ps. Nothing excites my cat quite like the sound of a crinkly foil ball. Just make sure not to let them play with them unsupervised so they don’t end up eating any foil.

Pps. You can also leash train them and take them on “walks” outside. I say walks but it will more likely be lazing around in the grass, occasionally chasing after a bug.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject2,, 2021-08-21 19:36:18 , reddit post ," You don’t need to be fluent but it is respectful to show that you put in some amount of effort to learn the language. I think it also depends on how difficult it is to learn the language. It is easier to learn French or Spanish as a native English speaker than it is to learn Arabic or Russian. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t still learn some useful vocabulary but it will likely be less realistic to expect to have much functional use of that language. But being able to recognize and speak a couple key words shows respect.

It also depends on your reasons for visiting and the length of your stay. If you are going as a tourist for more than a day or two, you really should make an effort to learn a bit of the language. In the other hand, my dad has been sent on work trips to non English speaking countries and with the amount of notice he was given and the fact that he would be spending the majority of his time on site, working in a lab alone or with people who spoke English, he did not need to spend much time learning the local language.

Basically, its best to learn the language if you can. Especially if you are visiting the country for leisure. "

The thing is, I know he would never offer to do anything he doesn’t want to do. Not for anyone. And he offered to try. I know none of y’all are mind readers and I sure hope none of y’all are him or that would be mortifying. I was just interested on hearing different perspectives on this situation.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject2,, 2021-08-18 17:19:44 , reddit post ," I’m a swim instructor so I’m in the pool 6 days a week sometimes. I’m still relatively new to CGM and I don’t follow it strictly.

I use Paul Mitchell Shampoo Three every time I wash my hair after being in the chlorine. Its definitely not curly girl approved because it is literally a clarifying shampoo but it gets the chlorine out. I often don’t have time to rinse my hair before getting in the pool as I also lifeguard and have to switch back and forth between guarding and being in the pool sometimes so the chlorine is gonna get in my hair.

After I shampoo, I just put tons of conditioner in my hair. I use a couple different Shea Moisture conditioners. They all do slightly different things but I just use my three favorites. I keep one at work and one at home and I just buy whichever of the three that is in stock when I run out. Anyway, I put a generous amount of conditioner on my hair and let it set for a few minutes before rinsing it out. Sometimes, I rinse it out once and then put some more on my hair and do a cold rinse and just rinse the excess conditioner out. Other times I just go straight for the cold rinse with the first conditioner. I never rinse all the conditioner out at the end of my shower, I always leave a bit on my hair.

When I’m home, I throw my hair up in a shower cap for the remainder of my shower. At work, I just make sure not to get my head under the water again so I can keep the remaining conditioner from rinsing out.

When I get out, I wring out my hair gently so its not dripping everywhere and then I leave it down to dry a bit more as I put my moisturizer and oils and such on my face. After that, I apply Shea Moisture Curl Enhancing Smoothie at the roots and comb it through gently with my fingers. Then, I follow with The Ordinary’s Marula Oil or Chia Seed Oil. I use ~3-5 droppers of oil and work it through my hair. After that, I apply 2-3 pumps of Shea Moisture Frizz Free Curl Mousse and work that through my hair. Then, I leave my hair down to air dry.

I’m still figuring out how to style my curls but that keeps my hair soft and healthy. I also have one of those silicone scalp brushes that I use at home with my shampoo.

My hair is still working on deciding its curl pattern. It just keeps getting curlier but right now its looking like 2b/2c.

On days that I’m not in the pool, I do a sort of no poo/cowash. I just put a ton of conditioner in my hair, massage it in, squish my hair a bit, and rinse the excess out with cold water. And once every 1-2 weeks I do an ACV rinse in the shower after I shampoo and before I condition.

I’m still figuring out what my hair likes and doesn’t and I probably shouldn’t be using clarifying shampoo every day but its better than leaving the chlorine in. This is just what has worked best so far. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject2,, 2021-08-06 02:40:48 , reddit post ," I went to the ER for severe lower pelvic pain to the point I couldn’t even yell out for my mom. I tried and only a whimper came out. When my mom finally woke up and came into my room I was white as a sheet, soaked in sweat, and shivering. She drove me to the ER, I waited in the waiting room for almost 2 hours. They finally got me back and it took three tries to get an IV with a morphine drip in even though I have really good veins. They shuffled me from room to room around the hospital for another couple hours but at least they had me in one of those wheeled beds by that point.

Finally, they got me into a ‘room’ (it was a double with a curtain as a door). They spent a couple more hours running tests but I was in less pain because the morphine (still a lot of pain but not as excruciating). All the tests came back negative and all they could see on the scans was gas. It was so embarassing. They basically just sent me home and told me to take some tums.

It was definitely not just gas. The gas was blocking them from seeing whatever was actually happening but they didn’t bother to look further. I had already spent over 12 hours in the ER and I was feeling well enough to walk by this point so I just ended up going home and not bothering to push for more diagnostics.

This was several years ago. It was way before covid. I understand ERs are insanely busy and I should have pursued further diagnostics with my primary care or gyn but I was a teenager and I was embarassed by being diagnosed with “just gas” and I just wanted the whole thing over with.

It just sucks that you can go into the ER in such severe pain that your body is literally experiencing shock and you are unable to walk and you can sit in the waiting room for nearly two hours. It was genuinely terrifying. I thought I was dying.

That was my first taste of what I suspect to be endo pain. It was really infrequent at first but it has gotten to the point that I get pain like that for about 75% of my periods. Still no diagnosis. Granted, some of that is on me. I need to get on that shit and set up an appointment with a gyn since mine moved several states away. Its still incredibly frustrating. "

I have had several pelvic ultrasounds after these “attacks” or whatever they are and all they can ever see is just tons of gas. And by the time the gas clears up enough to see anything it all looks normal. It is so frustrating.

And the gas pain is so awful. It just doesn’t go away. It hurts to move. It hurts to eat. It hurts to do literally anything. I am so bloated and my belly is so sensitive right now that even wearing loose fitting clothing hurts. I’m hungry but I can’t eat anything without severe pain. And the farts HURT. And they barely do anything to relieve the gas. It is so frustrating.

I literally have no diagnosis for anything, either. Is it endo? PCOS? IBS? Something else? Idk! I am just so done with the pain. It literally wipes me out for days. I am physically exhausted. I can’t live like this. And Idk what to do because I can’t afford to take time off work right now to go to countless doctor’s appts until they figure out what is going on.

There is a nationwide shortage and everybody is desperate. Look at rec centers and YMCAs if you are up north because they likely have indoor pools with year round employment for lifeguards. Due to the shortage, pay for lifeguards is increasing in many places.

As a25 with ADHD abd less than fantastic social skills who has not graduated college and still living eith my parents, I find lifeguarding to be a pretty good job. With a background in any kind of management you could work your way to being a head lifeguard or something.

The only drawback is its not exactly a quick fix. You do need to get certified which can cost like $200 and you need to find a place offering lifeguard courses. With covid, there are fewer courses offered.

Obviously you do have to be able to swim which I understand is a limitation for many. But if you can, I think it might be something worth looking into. At least as a stepping stone to make some money. "

Then, I follow with a ton of Shea Moisture Manuka Honey and  Mafura Oil Intensive Moisture Conditioner. Then I rinse it out in cold water. I personally don’t rinse out the conditioner completely because I have super dry hair and the Paul Mitchell shampoo only makes that worse.

Then I let my hair air dry and while its damp but not soaking wet, I will apply a bit of oil. I use Marula oil and Chia Seed oil from The Ordinary mixed with the Argan oil I find at my supermarket.

It can also help to soak your hair before going in the pool or applying conditioner.

Part of the problem is neither of us really know how to make the first move and we chicken out given the chance. But this past year brought us a lot closer. We’ve actually had some new coworkers think we’re a couple.

He’s never been in a relationship. He’s hooked up plenty but nothing beyond that. I think just letting it happen naturally without actually making any big moves is probably gonna work.

He’s also initiated interactions with me a lot and he doesn’t do that with anybody. He’s perfectly happy to stay home alone for weeks on end but he reaches out to me and invites me out. It could also just be that he sees me as a good, reliable friend.

I knew enough to not run away or answer the phone or the door. I knew not to mess with the stove or light candles. I was able to make sure my sister didn’t do something stupid. I knew enough basic first aid if either of us got a scrape or a cut or bumped our head.

If you can’t trust your 9yo to be unsupervised for 5 minutes how are they gonna handle the freedom they have when they are older? Probably not very well. They will be overwhelmed and not how to think for themselves. You need to teach your child independence. Kids do not need constant 24/7 supervision. Its not even healthy. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject2,, 2021-05-15 20:42:16 , reddit post ," I was dxed with ADHD as a child and suspect I am also autistic and I experience this too. I think it also has something to do with me how I don’t think in words or pictures but in ideas, if that makes sense. I find it difficult to articulate my thoughts (I’m honestly struggling trying to explain it here, ngl).

Its like I think in color 3D but have to communicate in 2D in black and white. There’s just so much more going on that I can’t explain my thoughts properly without losing important data that I lack the tools to accurately convey. And I often end up with a disorganized jumble of half thoughts that I have to retroactively flesh out and assemble in a way that others can actually comprehend.

I either leave out important details when explaining myself or overcompensate and put in too many details. In both instances the other person often ends up more confused than before.

I find academic writing to be exhausting and mentally straining. Often in academic writing you are given a prompt and certain rules which you must adhere to. It is aready difficult enough to express my thoughts in a way that people can simply understand. To have to then adhere to certain rules only adds to that. When it’s a topic I am unfamiliar with or have no interest in it can become overwhelming. Often, with academic writing, you are tasked with writing about something which you do not fully understand yet. Trying to write about something I am still learning about means I can’t even tell if my thoughts make sense before I try and form them into words. The whole process is just so daunting.

Whoops, I went on a bit of a tangent. But yeah, articulating my thoughts is hard and requires quite a bit of energy. And it has taken a long time for me to be able to do it as well as I can now. I’m 24. I always struggled with showing my work and explaining my thoughts. It still takes massive amounts of energy and patience. "

But then I wonder if I’ve just learned so much about autism that maybe I’m faking it. Like what if I do only have ADHD and I’m not autistic and I get tested but I know what autism looks like and I end up faking it in the test and get dxed with autism when I’m not actually autistic.

And then I wonder why I would do that. It doesn’t even make sense. What would be the point. Like if I relate so much to other autistics and autistic behavior feels right to me then I probably actually am autistic.

I’ve learned to mask my whole life. I don’t appear autistic at first glance but if you spend any amount of time with me, you’ll see I function differently. I display many common autistic traits. I just learned how to make them less obvious.

I still do wonder if I’m just looking for something to be wrong with me, though. If I’m just trying to find an excuse or seeking attention. Maybe I’m not autistic. Maybe I’m just trying to make excuses.

I realize that’s probably just ableism talking, though. But how can I be sure? And what does it even matter? There’s a reason I think I’m autistic and if a dx can help me then thats a good thing, right? "

• communicating with and understanding babies and young children (more than with adults tbh)
• quick thinking

• microscopes. My favorite part of bio. I want to eventually get my own microscope. They are so much fun.
• Neurological development and neuroology. Particularly regarding babies and young children and the way they develop and grow and learn
• math, I’ve kind of hit a wall with it in terms of school but I still love it
• genetics but I really don’t know anything beyond basic 8th grade bio about genetics. But I find it fascinating.
• photography
• textiles and fashion. Like learning about different fibers and blends and weaves and their characteristics. But I hate sewing.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject2,, 2021-03-18 04:46:43 , reddit post ," It seems that a lot of what you are struggling with is the idea that your breast tissue is more than you thought. I keep struggling with how to phrase this but as someone who has tendencies to obsess over things like measuring and remeasuring I think it might be healthiest for you to stop measuring. Put the tape measure away. Your size in clothing is not nearly as important as your mental health and at this point it seems to be causing you more stress. I don’t mean to sound condescending even though I probably do. I just know from experience that whenever I get really hung up on something, constantly checking and rechecking it only makes me feel worse about it. Regardless of what it is.

As for bras, I’ve found that knowing my band size has helped me find more comfortable compression sports bras without even worrying about my cup size. I’ve seen someone recommend tomboyx and while I personally love their stuff I’ve found their bras don’t provide much compression. At least not for someone with a 30” band. They are super comfy though. I’ve found that extra small long line compression sports bras work best for me for making me look flat. I personally like to throw a nude undershirt or cami overtop because its hard to find sports bras in neutral colors these days. I recently found a sports bra at a thrift store that I really like as far as making me look flatter while still being comfortable. I have not actually looked it up but the brand is pro-fit and it says its the seamless style in small. I really like it because its not racerback so it works with shirts that are less athletic looking.

I hope you find something that helps you feel more comfortable with your body and is actually just comfortable in general as well. I know I’m not the best person to give advice considering I’m cis but I hope I’ve helped you at least a little. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject2,, 2021-03-18 01:22:25 , reddit post ," I’m a 30E so my boobs are bigger than yours. I still get told my chest looks really small and flat. Sometimes thats the goal for me. Even though I’m cis, I never actually wanted boobs. They’re just incredibly impractical and annoying. Honestly, I wish humans were like other mammals and our breasts were just completely flat when we are not actively breastfeeding but I guess evolution decided that wasn’t necessary for us.

Anyway, I’ve found decent compression with random sports bras in XS from plato’s closet. I’m not sure if you have anything similar near you or of you even feel comfortable going in to a store and looking at sports bras.

I do understand it can be difficult to be told your size is something like a D or DD. That’s probably a lot to take in. And its not comfortable to think about that. I know it doesn’t help but the ‘science’ behind the size is that the difference in circumference between your underbust and bust is the only factor that determines your cup size. Since the underbust is closer to your waist, the circumference will likely be a few inches shorter than the bust measurement, simply because your chest widens as you get closer to your shoulders and away from your waist. Thats just how ribs are shaped. If you have particularly large pecs and lats, your bust measurement will be several inches larger than your underbust measurement even if you have zero breast tissue. I know it might be hard to really believe that right now. Thats completely understandable.

Even if that difference is breast tissue, it can look different depending on how it it is dispersed on your chest. I think it can be quite difficult to understand how that makes sense so I will try and draw a diagram to explain it better.

I think another difficult thing for you after seeing the calculator give you a size D or DD is how it has been ingrained in our minds by media that a D cup is really big and a DD cup is huge. I know many people have mentioned that that is incorrect but something that has been so ingrained into your mind can be difficult to unlearn. Especially when it is about something that has caused you so much distress as gender dysphoria. Having DD cups makes you no more voluptuous than wearing extra wide shoes makes you have big feet. I mean if you wear extra wide shoes and are a size 12 in shoes, yeah you might have big feet. Just as if you are a 38DD, your boobs will not be small. But if your shoe size is 7WW your feet will still be pretty small. A 30D is not nearly as big as it sounds. And if you’ve lived your whole life thinking a D cup is really big it won’t make sense. That is completely valid.

I hope you have luck finding something that works for you. I’d recommend looking on etsy as well. You could also check out rebirthgarments.com. And please don’t be discouraged. "

I put a bunch of cinnamon and like a tablespoon or two of maple syrup in and I can’t even taste the apple.

Idk if it makes a difference but I use steel cut oats and put 2 parts liquid (milk, water, nut milk, etc. but I like milk) and 1 part oats.

Budget - under $40

Source - laptop

Requirements for isolation - doesn’t matter, she’ll be using them in the house and it’s pretty quiet.

Will you be using these headphones in public? - probably not

Preferred type of headphones - wired, she wants to be able to just plug them into her laptop and have them work, she gets nervous with technology so wireless is out of the question. She also needs a mic. She wants headphones or earbuds that won’t fall out.

Preferred tonal balance - overall balance

Past headphones - she’s never actually had her own but she likes how my apple earpods sound when she’s borrowed them, they just fall out of her ear a lot. She likes how my iLuv True Wireless Air earbuds fit but she does not want bluetooth. The iLuvs also have a pretty awful mic.

Preferred Music - classic rock and jazz

What would you like to improve on from your setup - headphones she can easily use that won’t fall out of her ear, sound good enough for meetings, decent mic, and that are her own.

Additional considerations - stereo isn’t necessary, if its earbuds it might actually be nice for her if they work in either ear. Or if they have the L/R marked clearly.

That doesn’t mean it will happen but most 16yos are at very different places in their life than 25yos. Not just that but it creates this uneven power dynamic where the older person often has more control than the younger person simply because of the difference in amount of life experience. And why is that older person interested in someone so much younger in the first place? Can they not find someone closer to their own age? An older person who wants to control and manipulate someone would have a much easier time controlling a teenager than another adult. I’m not saying that there aren’t exceptions to this. As someone in their mid 20s who has friends who are in their teens, I don’t think it is often that both parties will be satisfied in a relationship where one is a teenager and the other is an adult several years older. Its not about the sex, its about the relationship and power dynamic that develop when the sex occurs. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject2,, 2021-03-03 04:53:52 , reddit post ," I’m a woman but I’ve been in a situation where I didn’t realize how young a guy was. He was 18 and I was in my 20s but it made me think about what might have happened if he was like 16. I’ve realized I can look quite a bit younger than I am and teens can look older than they are. It taught me to be more careful. A 16yo might have seen me and thought I was 18 and that 16yo might have looked 20 to me and we both would have thought it was fine. Its even harder for guys, I think because its more likely for society to see it as rapey when the guy is older than the girl. It shouldn’t be that way but it is. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject2,, 2021-03-03 04:37:44 , reddit post , Its not statutory rape if both parties are below the age of consent. At least not where I live. Like if a 14yo and 15yo had sex it would be completely legal in the eyes of the law. I think the Rand J laws in my area are its okay if there is a difference of less than 2 years if one party is below the age of consent and one party is above. Since the age of consent here is 17yo it would be okay for an 18 yo to have sex with a 16yo or a 15yo to have sex with a 17yo.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject2,, 2021-02-25 09:18:18 , reddit post ," I’ve been thinking in might be something like ovarian cysts because I have had a scan where two relatively small ones showed up. It seems to be related to my period. I’m not sure if its caused by something hormonal or to with my reproductive organs or if my period just exacerbates something else down there.

The biggest issue I seem to have with the tests is they always want to do ultrasound first. If nothing shows up and I’m feeling better then they drop it after that. But they can never see anything on ultrasound because there’s always so much gas in the way. And I know its not JUST gas. I know gas pains can be really bad but it feels different. Like the gas seems to be a side effect of whatever is going on but its not the main issue. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject2,, 2021-02-25 08:11:57 , reddit post ," I once went to the ER for stomach pain so bad I literally couldn’t move or even call out for help. I ended up just passing out from the pain and going to my dr in the morning. She sent me to the ER. They ran all sorts of tests, they couldn’t see anything cause I had too much gas. By the time they were done with their tests I hadn’t eaten in over 24 hours but the pain had subsided and I went home.

That odd stomach pain has happened several times since then. The worst time happened just as my dad was waking up in the morning. He saw me in distress and woke my mom. It was during covid and I didn’t want to deal with the hospital and it was a few hours before urgent care places opened up for the day in my area. I managed to tell my mom that I would go to urgent care when they opened because I really did not want to deal with the ER. I ended up passing out from the pain and waking up with more manageable pain several hours later. My mom said she thought I was dying. She said that it looked like I was in more pain than I would be if I had been in labor.

I’m just so afraid to go to hospital, wait for hours, and get all sorts of testing done just for them to be able to see nothing but gas and then charge me thousands of dollars. And if I make an appointment to see my dr I won’t get in for at least a day and then they won’t be able to do any diagnostics and by the time I get in for an ultrasound I’ll be feeling better. "

Assuming he is a boy. It can be hard to tell when they are neonates. Look up kitten lady. She has some excellent resources for caring for neonatal kittens. If possible, weigh him daily to make sure he is gaining weight. If he starts losing weight you might want to start supplementing him with some kitten milk replacer (kmr). Don’t use cow’s milk. It will upset his system and not help things. It will probably give him the runs which will only dehydrate him and cause him to lose more weight. And as other commenters have mentioned, make sure he stays warm. He can’t regulate his own temperature yet. And fix the father asap. And make sure mama cat doesn’t go into heat, cats in heat will do anything to get out and find a boy cat. Mama cats can go into heat before their most recent litter is even weaned.

In 4th grade I got into the Dear America books. In 5th grade I got into Cornelia Funke’s Inkheart series and then some of her other books and then got into the Warrior Cats books and that lasted me through 6th grade.

I eventually got into Discworld around junior year and that quickly became one of my favorite series.

Thinking about this kinda makes me sad because I realize I have read so few new books since I graduated high school several years ago.

And you’ll probably need to clean out the velcro every so often to get the fur out. My older cat’s fur is legit like 5” long though. And it still works great.

And there are like no other decent doctors in my area accepting patients that are covered by my insurance. The fun thing is, my insurance will not cover meds that do not go through their specific pharmacy. But that pharmacy will not send out less than a 90 day supply. So I have to go through a different pharmacy and not get my vyvanse covered by insurance. And the pharmacy that I do go through will occasionally get confused and not give me my vyvanse because they think it was a mistake that my doctor called it in to them because it would be much cheaper to go through the other pharmacy. So I have to sort that out like ever couple months. And then when I’m due for a refill on a holiday right before a weekend like thanksgiving I’m SOL.

I didn’t see any of the planes but for quite a while after that when I saw planes in the sky I’d ask if the people on the planes were going to die. Thankfully, I didn’t know anybody who had died but I still was concerned. Kids pick up on more than you’d expect. They can tell something is important based on how people around them react. I didn’t know what had happened yet, or that people had died but I still remember seeing the planes on the news. I still remember getting picked up from school early. People were scared so I remembered what was happening. If kids see that something exploded when they’ve seen other launches without an explosion they will probably remember it and ask questions.

I also have an extra bone in my ankle to make things worse. I actually did go to the dr about that cause it was really painful during puberty cause apparently it was growing. I also feel really self conscious about wearing fancy shoes that show off my ankles. I’m a girl and I love shoes but they always fit me so awkwardly. And capris just draw attention right to my bony ankles.
I mean it could always be worse but I’ve never seen anyone else with such pointy ankles. "

Some wouldn’t even accept work handed in after the class it was due. I had one professor that didn’t accept any late work. She dropped your lowest hw, lab, and quiz grade for the semester and if your final exam grade was higher than your lowest test grade she’d replace your lowest test grade with your final exam. But if you missed lab or failed to turn in an assignment by the time class started you were SOL. She’d only let you make up work when it was legally mandated like if you had proof you were literally in the hospital. And even so, you could only make up a total of three days missed in a semester. And you still had to turn it in the same amount of days later as the rest of the class. Like if an assignment was given on a monday and was due on wednesday it would be due two days after she sent it to you to make it up. "

But its worth it. And once you find a hobby that you’re passionate about, it’ll help your confidence and you’ll have something to talk about. I think its wonderful to hear someone talk about something they’re passionate about even if its not something I’m interested in. And yeah, it definitely sounds cliche, but its true.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject2,, 2020-10-28 00:42:52 , reddit post ," Thats fair but it is worth mentioning that measuring ecological impact requires analyzing more than just CO2 emissions. There is the deforestation required to meet the demands of growing certain crops such as avocados. The water crisis in california is worth mentioning as they grow quite a lot (I don’t have the actual statistics and I’m on mobile) of the almonds, grapes, and pistachios consumed in the US. These crops require far more water than is sustainable and the environment is suffering, not to mention the devastating effects on farmers and the economy. There are a lot of factors involved in measuring ecological impact, CO2 emissions is a big one but it is not the only one. And obviously, it depends on what exactly you eat, as you mentioned pork, poultry, fish, and eggs have a much lower CO2 impact than beef. Rice and quinoa have a greater impact on greenhouse gas emission than many other crops. Someone who doesn’t eat much meat but eats eggs, poultry, and fish might have a comparable impact or even a lower impact on greenhouse emissions to a vegan who consumes a lot of rice, quinoa, coffee, and avocados. I suppose its just more complex than just saying that vegans, vegetarians, or omnivores inherently have a greater impact on the environment than the others. Its more about being aware of how different foods and their manufacturing impact the environment than an entire diet as a whole. There are likely trends regarding the impact of each diet but it varies between the individual following that diet. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject2,, 2020-10-27 07:19:07 , reddit post ," You can afford to eat a balanced vegan diet no matter your budget if you like potatos, oatmeal, and whatever fruits and veggies are in season. It might not be the most exciting diet but add some spices to make it more interesting. And eating organic will only make it more expensive. Also, frozen fruits and veggies are a cheaper alternative to fresh and can be just as nutritious.

A vegan diet can be as healthy or unhealthy as literally any other diet. Obviously it depends on certain dietary restrictions mandated by your health and some people simply cannot thrive on a vegan diet. But other people can be completely healthy eating vegan. You just have to be smart and do your research. There is also plenty of vegan junk food. Eating vegan is as healthy as you make it.

Veganism is not any more environmentally friendly than any other diet by default. It can be more environmentally friendly to eat locally sourced, native food that contains animal products than to eat vegan. Veganism can be environmentally friendly if you want, you just have to research what foods are both vegan and environmentslly friendly.

There are probably more and you might already be aware of these. Honestly, it really depends on your own experiences what your preconcieved notions are regarding veganism. These are just the ones that came to mind when thinking about many of the things that people assume about veganism. I’m no nutritionist or anything. No expert on diets. I’m not even vegan, as I mentioned. I just know a lot of people who are vegan for various reasons and come from many different backgrounds. "

Drysol seems to work during all other times for my underarm sweating, I haven’t used it on my feet. I’ve tried it on my torso and legs when I get really sweaty before my period and its completely ineffective.

I’ve talked to my doctor and she’s stumped. My thyroid and other hormone levels seem perfectly fine. And it only really bothers me like this in the days leading up to my period.

None of that was okay with my parents, especially with two young children in the house. They initially intended for her to stay a few weeks until she got a job and she had to be actively looking for a job but she never actually was looking for a job. They eventually gave her like ten days to make arrangements to live somewhere else and whether or not she had some place to go after those ten days she was out. Looking back I don’t know how we did it. We have a rather small house and it was in the winter so it was probably pretty cramped and she was such a slob. "

There are also chew toys for kittens at pet stores but my kittens never like those.

Kittens will also push things off tables and ledges and desks and shelves. This habit will likely continue even as adults and into old age. Try to make sure you have nothing they could push off that would break if it fell.

I personally think it is a good idea to get your kitten used to wearing a harness and leash regardless of if you plan on walking them. You can put them in a harness in their carrier when you take them to the vet. Its helpful if you ever end up in an unfamiliar environment with your cat. Its just nice to know that your cat will be comfortable in a harness if you ever need it. But also walking your cat (well typically its more like them walking you, they lead) is a great activity for both you and your cat. Especially if they are a more energetic and curious kitty. Its the safest way for them to explore the outdoors.

Get them used to being handled for things like toothbrushing, nail trims, brushing, etc. so they don’t freak out whenever you need to do that. If they know what to expect and are familiar with what you’re doing they are more likely to be comfortable and not stressed.

Work on bite control, especially if they are a singleton. Kittens learn what hurts and what doesn’t through playing with other kittens. I’ve seen people mention kitten lady’s videos and I agree. Do that.

Make sure you have places of various elevations for them to explore. Get a cat tree. It will provide enrichment and comfort. Cats like being high up.

Cats will learn your routine and adapt. If you are late for feeding time they will tell you.

As for flea meds, I personally use Catego. It lasts one month and is safe for use on cats at least 8 weeks old and at least 2lbs. But do your research and figure out what works best for you. I am personally not a fan of flea collars for cats. I’ve found topical treatments work best.

Best of luck! Cats are amazing! "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject2,, 2020-08-31 02:55:17 , reddit post ," I think OP sees her cat killing birds and risking getting hit by cars and stolen by neighbors as necessary enrichment for her, unfortunately. You can thoroughly enrich your cat’s life without letting them wander unsupervised outside. Call me crazy, many do, but I take my cat hiking on a leash, she loves it. I teach her tricks, which is absolutely possible. She has tons of toys, hiding places, climbing places, and window ledges. She can go out on the porch, supervised. Owning a cat is a responsibility and a time commitment. It is simply irresponsible to get a cat and let them wander outside, especially if you are aware of the dangers. I don’t hate outdoor cats. I love cats. I am concerned for their wellbeing because I know of the dangers. I had an indoor/outdoor cat who got hit by a car and died. He was healthy. He probably had another 5-10+ years left. I live on a side street. We don’t get much traffic. All the neighbors knew him. We thought it was safe. Until it wasn’t. That’s the thing. Its safe until its not and usually by that point its too late. Just save yourself the grief and keep your kitty inside. I know its hard. The change will be hard. Your kitty will complain and try to dart outside at every chance. But your kitty can live a happy, fulfilling life inside.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject2,, 2020-08-19 07:13:25 , reddit post ," I’m not sure what you’ve used as rewards and all cats are different, the ones that are not food motivated require some thinking outside the box. As far as food rewards, my cats go crazy for greenies. I had one cat who LOVED cheese, especially piave. As long as you feed it in moderation and ONLY use it for training rewards, if the cat likes it, use it. I had another cat who loved popcorn. Try different foods. Wet food, while messy, can also be a high value reward for cats. I’ve seen tubes of liquid cat food, I think they’re called Churus that cats seem to love. Another idea is meat sticks. They look kinda like jerky sticks. My cats love the salmon sticks from the puppy section at petco. Another thing to try is catnip, there are variations of catnip, too. I have a cat who only likes one kind of catnip. My neighbor’s cat goes crazy for catnip, his owners don’t want us feeding him so I give him catnip instead. I also had a cat who loved yogurt. Idk how much of that you’ve tried or if he’s even food motivated at all.

Another thing to try as a reward is play. I’m not sure how you feel in regards to real fur toys but I’ve found mouse toys made of real rabbit fur tend to be very popular with cats. They can tell its real animal fur even if its been processed. Feather teasers are a good toy, as well. It really just depends on the cat. My old lady cat isn’t super motivated by food or play or catnip, but I’ve found she absolutely LOVES being brushed. Just experiment. It can be a lot of fun figuring out what really excites your cat. Just remember, moderation is key, especially with food. And the reward has to be something they don’t have access to outside of training. Good luck! Your cat sounds so cool. "

I guess that means I am ADHD-PI and INTP "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject2,, 2018-11-27 04:15:06 , reddit post ," Same. Well similar. I have a couple friends who just kinda accept my awkwardness and roll with it. They just are rarely ever around. But also I’m still taking freshman level courses in college after being in college for almost 5 years and still have no idea what I’m doing with my life and at this point I just want an associates in whatever is easiest for me to get. I live with my parents too. My little sister sometimes hangs out with me. Don’t even ask me how many classes I’ve failed in college, I’ve lost count. Also I just feel like everyone thinks I’m weird and awkward and a bit rude and possibly gross and they only talk to me out of convenience like at work or because they need something from me. Rejection sensitive dysphoria is a thing and its stupid. Look it up. I hate it. Also I just feel constantly out of the loop and excluded from everything. And I get overwhelmed so easily I feel like I can’t handle any real responsibility and I’m pretty sure everyone else agrees with that. Idk what my point is but ADHD has fucked with my life and I just wish it would stop. Thats another thing, I always lose my point whenever I try to make one. Its annoying. "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject2, [Skin Concerns] Lotion and cream pilling on skin , 2018-01-09 20:52:06 , reddit post , So I know this subreddit is mostly about facial skincare but I figured somebody might be able to help me out with this. I’ve noticed that whenever I put any lotion or cream on my legs it kinda pills or balls up after a little while and then just flakes off. It happens even if I don’t put a lot on and it doesn’t matter if I shave my legs first or not. Does anyone else experience this? Why is this happening? What can I do to prevent this?

eRisk2022-T3_Subject2,, 2017-05-09 05:51:54 , reddit post , Same. I'm on a course to fail 2 more classes this semester. That would be my 8th and 9th classes failed since I started college... and I'll have passed 6 classes and withdrawn from like 7 classes. I feel like an absolute loser cause I keep trying and working with my therapist and my professors and my parents and I keep failing. I was talking with my best friend and he reminded me that despite everything I am really good at math and I really enjoy learning. I totally forgot where I was going with this and what my point was but yeah I guess I just gotta keep pushing on and not give up. 
eRisk2022-T3_Subject2,, 2017-05-08 00:28:17 , reddit post ," I would get

American eagle dark wash skinny jeans
Black leggings
A striped tshirt from old navy or the gap
Ankle booties from ralph lauren
Black low top converse
A floral sun dress
A solid peach t shirt
Denim 5"" shorts
A denim jacket
A cardigan in grey heather or yellow

Those are my favorite clothes. My 11th item would be birkenstocks. The striped tee may or may not be from the mens section.

eRisk2022-T3_Subject2,, 2017-02-23 21:06:37 , reddit post ," I've struggled a lot with this idea, trying to keep the conversation about the person doing the confiding while also sharing ideas and experiences. I think it helps to know the context, like is that person just trying to confide in you or are they asking for help? In situations like this unsolicited advice can come off as rude and insensitive. That person might not be looking for suggestions and just looking to let something out. It might come across as if the person is not really listening or as if the person is trying to invalidate their feelings. But sometimes that person is looking for someone else who may have shared their experiences or they may be looking for advice. I guess what I'm trying to say is if you aren't sure what is expected of you as a listener or as a friend, maybe ask what kind of support they are looking for. It will probably feel awkward for some but it shows that you really care about that person and how they are feeling.


Tl;dr if you are unsure what a person wants from you, ask if they are looking for advice and to hear your similar experiences or just a listening ear "
