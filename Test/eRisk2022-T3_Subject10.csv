Basically, I found out that it’s apparently possible to ovulate without getting your period, so even if they aren’t getting them, pregnancy is still possible. I’m sure some of them have additional help from fertility treatments, etc, too. Beyond that, (despite having no evidence to back this up) I wouldn’t be totally shocked if some models have faked the baby bump, and used a surrogate secretly- it would also explain how certain models are able to maintain their body post pregnancy without any changes to their weight.

Not eating can mean you lack nutrition that can cause weaker teeth, so the fluoride in toothpaste is especially important. Also, dehydration (from fasting, ingesting caffeine, smoking, etc) is really bad for teeth because it allows bacteria to thrive, and can further cause brittle teeth because the saliva that normally provides a protective coating to teeth is no longer protecting them. It’s similar reasoning for why meth users lose their teeth- they don’t eat (meth effects appetite), usually are nutrient deficient, and have dry mouths from dehydration, all of which lead to the infamous meth mouth.

In terms of advice, I genuinely have no idea how to approach it with my own dad, so I can’t really help with that aspect unfortunately.

If you’re underweight, then any treatment would begin with weight restoration, but if you’re not underweight, then I would imagine that as long as you weren’t engaged in any of your ‘purging’ behaviors to maintain your weight, then I don’t see why you couldn’t. I don’t know your history, but I think that the only potential issue would be if you stopped purging through throwing up but replaced it with purging via exercising, or starvation/fasting. In totality, I think you could avoid gaining weight, but it might require you to be vigilant about doing it in a healthy way, so the best support might be consulting with a nutritionist. "

When I get stuck in the binge-restrict cycle, the only thing that really puts the cycle to rest is forcing myself to stop eating more once I’ve reached what would be considered a ‘normal’ portion of food, or less. It’s agonizing resisting the urge the first time, but it really helps acclimate your experience of satiety. When I’m really struggling with resisting the urge to binge, I try and make plans with friends for meals, because if I’m with someone I know I wont get an opportunity to do it. When im not able to have company for meals, I try to schedule something immediately after it so that i won’t have time to binge. I think the worst part of binging is how first it seems like a get out of jail free card, and then it gets addictive and you keep pushing your limits further and further, and by the time you realize it’s a problem, it’s become a habit that seems impossible to control "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject10,, 2021-07-21 17:34:03 , reddit post ," So sorry to hear that your daughter is struggling like this, her story reminds me a lot of my own.

I think the first thing you need to do is sit down with your husband, and make sure you’re on the same page about what you’re observing with your daughter, which can serve as a basis for a much needed discussion about refraining from talking about weight (and weight loss), or making comments about how much/how little she’s eating, all of which can be incredibly triggering for someone with an ED.

As for helping your daughter transition to college, In my own experience, the college environment exacerbated my ED in many ways, but it also facilitated an amazing support network in recovery. Most schools offer free therapy to students, which is something that I think your daughter could really benefit from. I’m not if this is as common, but my school had a nutritionist who students could meet with via appointment, and  if your daughter is open to it, this could be an additional support for her, should she need it.

As for your marriage, if it were me, I’d decide to do whatever made me happiest, because the best thing for your daughter is having a loving and supportive family, regardless of whether you provide it separately, or as a couple. My parents got divorced when I was in highschool, and while it was hard for me to deal with it at first, coming home to a happy, attentive parent, versus coming home to a screaming match and a household full of chaos and resentment, made the divorce the best thing for everyone, and sometimes I wish it had happened earlier so I hadn’t grown up with that kind of turbulence around. They say the best way to treat a child’s anxiety is to treat their parents’, and I think this yields true for families in general- we internalize the feelings of those closest to us more than we realize, and it influences our behavior.

Lastly, I think it might be helpful for both you and your husband to meet with a therapist that specializes in treating people with eating disorders, so you can learn more about what your daughter may be struggling with. My father worked w someone like this, and he learned a lot about what was and wasn’t appropriate to say and do around me regarding food/ED stuff. He also got to unpack a lot of his own issues surrounding food and weight, which definitely contributed to my own ED struggles. I think because of the situation your describing with your husband and his families’ history with ED’s, this could be really useful for everyone involved. At the end of the day,  no parent or family can really be perfect, and while a messy house might symbolize some of what’s going on below the surface, cleaning the house will not address the preponderant issue.

I hope that this helps, and it’s awesome that you’re such a caring and loving mother. Your daughter is very lucky to have someone like you in her life. Best of luck to you both :blue_heart: "

Lol jokes aside tho, I 100% know that feeling and struggle. For me, it honestly feels like my ED has wreaked so much daily havoc on me that i feel strange and uncomfortable if I’m not suffering. Because of that, I kinda feel like the reason I get intense urges to do ED shit after doing something healthy is my subconscious misinterpreting the unfamiliar feeling as some sort of threat, which it combats by trying to restore things to their regular state of misery, since it feels most normal to me to feel disordered. Idk what your history is with your ED but because humans are habitual, when we get used to something (good or bad), we expect it to remain, and any unexpected change is resisted at all costs "

It’s not uncommon for those in recovery to have insatiable hunger once they start eating normally again, because the body responds to food deprivation the way it would if you had experienced a famine. Once access to food is restored, the body goes into overdrive in terms of eating because it’s trying to replenish itself, but also to quickly gain excess weight so the next time food is scarce, the body can rely on its reserves for energy and has a better chance for survival. Obvi anorexia isn’t a famine, but the body reacts this way regardless, which could explain your different spells of eating behaviors. If so, it sounds like your body is doing it’s best to survive! I’m no doctor, so I can’t weigh in on the diagnostic part of your Q, but it def seems like it would make sense with everything else "

If it were me, I’d tell my sister that I love her and want to help her. Honestly, asking her directly what you can do to support her, or just listening in general are all great places to start.

People without Ed’s, confuse the idealized (underweight) women in pop culture,  with ‘normal’ and ‘healthy,’ which is probably why your bf doesn’t understand what underweight looks like.

I was kinda forced into it (my college doctor notified the school about how underweight I was and I had the choice between seeing their nutritionist or taking a compulsory medical leave), but I found it to be a mostly positive experience. My nutritionist took my weight and asked me about my eating patterns, and after the first meeting she recommended I start drinking ensure in order to increase my calorie intake without shocking my digestive system too much. After the first meeting, taking my weight and blood pressure became a routine followed by me telling her about what I was eating and how I felt about it, and then she would advise me on strategies for ways I could improve how I ate, and what I ate. For me, it was helpful in that I had more information, it felt more like advice than her telling me what I had to do, so i think the extent to which it will help you depends on whether you’ll take it on board.

I know from my own experience that malnutrition can often times result in poorer mental health, because often times I simply don’t have the energy to feel happy (or really any emotions). For me the worst of it wasn’t necessarily sadness or distress, it was more like I felt numb and exhausted. While I still have a raging ed, I’ve been working on living (aka spending less time dwelling in my ed behavior) rather than just doing the bare minimum and honestly, the more time I spend with friends, or doing things I enjoy, plus actually doing my work/hw (when school was still a thing) the better I have felt about life as a whole. I know how apathetic an Ed can make you feel when it consumes all your time and energy, so you’re definitely not alone, and I still feel like that sometimes, though it really helped me when I re-evaluated the extent to which I let it reign over the other areas of my life. I think having a balance worked in my favor, so if not in a place where recovery is something you want, I found that just engaging with things beyond it helped me and it could help you too "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject10,, 2020-07-01 11:24:20 , reddit post ," I totally get where you’re coming from, having an eating disorder is such an isolating condition already, so having it’s legitimacy questioned, and frankly reinforced by whoever made that Oreo comment (wtf!), gives you every right to feel exasperated. My ed situation is a little different, but I’ve def dealt with some similar issues with having people say things to me about how I look perfectly healthy (I’m underweight) and that I eat a normal amount (I don’t eat most days, and if I do eat I binge and then purge), so they can’t believe that anyone would be concerned about me possibly having an eating disorder, and even though this is usually meant in a complimentary way, having my ed struggle erased by how some else perceived me is possibly the most aggravating thing about it. Having people dismiss your pain due to ignorance and baseless assumptions regarding your situation is truly cruel, and I really hope you know that weight has very little to do with most eating disorders (it can be an indicator, but it’s no where near the full story), and your experience is absolutely valid. The only thing that shouldn’t be taken seriously in this ordeal are the opinions of people who clearly don’t understand what having an eating disorder is like "

Even as a teenager with an Ed, I was always a little shocked by how glamorous Ed’s were made out to be, and I think that when I first developed it part of myself was clinging to that portrayal because the idyllic and tragic illusion of Ed’s do a way better job of seducing you into the illness than the reality. Obviously developing an eating disorder is a lot more complex and nuanced than just choosing to starve yourself because tv made it look good, but I do think that society’s preoccupation with thinness very much reinforces it to some extent "

I think those that feel like they’re faking it are probably those that have less obvious symptoms where they have a few “normal” eating days or something like that but for those of us who exhibit their Ed everyday we’re too far down the rabbit hole at this point. I def sympathize with those who feel “fake” because that sounds horrible in its own right, and while I am definitely suffering due to my inability to stop my ed behavior, I also feel empowered by the identity and the solidarity I have with these Ed communities that help me cope and vent. So while it def sucks that I struggle with it literally every single day, I think it might be worse to feel like I didn’t fully belong because without this, I would truly feel alone "

In my own experience I first realized I had an Ed when food and the lack of started to become my greatest priority, to the effect that I would neglect or diminish other areas of my life to maintain restrict; for example I would cancel plans with friends if they involved food, or skip class because I didn’t have the energy to get out of bed because I couldn’t sleep since I was so hungry at night. Only you know how severe the issue is, but I often experienced minor periods of my life where I would restrict majorly for a couple months then go back to normal for years until my eating disorder came back years later and never left. The sooner you identify that you have this issue, though, the easier it is to get help and recover, so it’s awesome that you’re seeking help because if you resolve the issue (maybe try therapy?)  now before it gets out of control, you can prevent yourself from becoming entirely consumed by it. It’s a lot easier to fix a bad habit after a brief time, than it is to fix after years of living with an eating disorder, and since you’re so young right now, getting help could save you from the severe effects of malnourishment like hair loss and health determination. I know it probably is starting to take a toll on you so I hope you can figure out a way to get help now :two_hearts: "

I def have learned that unless I set some boundaries for myself, I am unable to be a decent and functioning human being, and one of those boundaries is that I never allow myself to bail on friends/fam/boyfriend (or school stuff) to do ED things. Unless I hold myself to that, I get into a dark spiral, and usually the more I force myself to live my actual life, the less power my Ed has over me.

From what I’ve experienced and heard from others, it’s a combination of environmental behavior, genetic predispositions, and what values you develop and internalize. Parents don’t have to be awful people to play a role in your Ed, and I would argue that this is way more widespread in our society than people think. For me, my parents were largely great parents but they did indoctrinate me with the belief that it wasn’t okay to show emotion, not because they told me that explicitly but I watched them never cry, or fully express their negative feelings and now I resort to Ed behaviors when I want to avoid or suppress negative emotions in my life today.

I think after a while your body slows down digestion, which probably leads to less calorie absorption prior to purging, meaning that you end up purging more calories than you absorb. I agree that the weight loss is nice but overtime I’ve basically ruined food for myself because unless I fast all day before I eat, I literally cannot eat a normal sized meal and feel “full” after, like now unless Im in pain from the amount of food in my stomach, it feels so unsatisfying and not worth the trouble "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject10,, 2020-06-19 09:18:55 , reddit post ," I’m not sure where you’re from, but in the US they can’t send you to an Ed treatment center without your consent since you’re 18. However, if they believe that you are a danger to yourself, they could force you into a 24 hour psych hold, but this wouldn’t include force feeding, and I doubt they would do that to someone who’s in need of the medical care you’re currently undergoing. In most states, the only way you could be force fed without your consent is if your parent or doctor/social worker went before a judge and petitioned for guardianship. In order to do this, they would need a lawyer to make the case that you’re too sick to be capable of making responsible medical decisions on behalf of yourself, and then the judge would need to assess your mental and physical state by consulting psychologists and doctors, and if your assessment convinced the judge that you’re not of sound mind, then they would grant the petition and temporary guardianship to either a family member or social worker which would then give that person the authority to allow you to be force fed. Because this process is lengthy, costly to both the state and hospital, and relies on multiple opinions, it is highly unlikely that this would happen unless the doctors believe that it is a life or death decision, and that you are in immediate danger. Since your parents aren’t involved, it doesn’t seem likely that any of this would happen. I’m not a lawyer or anything so def double check the laws specific to your location! Also, I’m truly sorry you’re having such a hard time right now, and I hope that this gives you enough of an answer that you have one less thing to worry about "

I think that since you’re voluntarily seeing a doctor now, though, you wouldn’t be able to be forced inpatient because you’re already seeking help. If I were you, I’d tell your mother that you are already seeking help, but you want to do it at your own pace and if she wants to help you, you need her to accept that this will only be successful if you do it on your own. There are plenty of statistics that show inpatient doesn’t work unless the person does it on their own.

The reason you’re so hungry is because after you restrict for a while (esp if it’s to an underweight BMI), once your body starts getting the nutrients it desperately needs, your survival instincts go into overdrive. Your body can’t tell the difference between a famine and anorexia so anytime you stop eating for long periods of time, once you start eating your body will tell you to keep eating as much as you can because it doesn’t know when you’ll have access to food again.

I know science says there’s genetic factors, traumatic experiences, certain triggering behaviors (deciding to diet), and personality factors (being highly sensitive to criticism, or being a perfectionist) and probably completely circumstantial happenstances (Ex:being in charge of cooking your own meals), additionally. I think if you focus too hard on making your Ed the fault of one moment or person, than you miss out on a lot of things that aren’t your fault, and may further influence Ed behavior if you don’t address them, or learn to move past them "

I wouldn’t donate if you were under that amount because if you’re underweight your blood may lack important nutrients like iron, which would make it less useful in terms of donation bc they can’t use that for a sick person. You might also want to consider your own health, I volunteered at a blood drive and smaller people tended to have more adverse reactions to giving blood, like seizures or fainting. Since giving blood also weakens your immune system potentially, I think you should reconsider donating. It’s very selfless of you to be thinking about others especially during this time, but I def think you should find a way that doesn’t jeopardize your health so much "

I think the issue that people take with it is that it often belittles the disease it’s trying to “cure.” In this case, acting like anorexics just never realized that you can be pretty AND eat food makes the illness seem pretty trivial. In reality, curing anorexia is a complex, ongoing process that typically requires medical professionals and the like. Acting as if the cure is that attainable completely dismisses the underlying causes of the disease and totally undermines the struggle of those suffering and the hardship faced by those in recovery "

I think it has to do with stomach size? When you don’t eat your stomach shrinks a bit but when you are eating frequently your stomach expands slightly and then physically your body wants it to be full so you’re hungrier
