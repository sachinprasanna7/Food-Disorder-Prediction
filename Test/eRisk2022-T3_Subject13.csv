eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2021-11-09 05:07:30 , reddit post ," Alright I guess that really good then, I thought there was something wrong since I heard many people talking about withdrawal stories. But thank you ! "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2021-11-09 05:04:52 , reddit post ," For alcohol the only thing I can say is to take it slow and avoid drinking fast to test your limits. For me personally it got me more drunk than usual for the first few times drinking but after that my tolerance went back to normal. This doesn’t mean it goes well for everyone because it does affect everyone differently.
And about the dosage, if the 75mg are helping you then that’s already good but if you don’t feel a difference going up would be a better option since 150mg is still not an overly high dosage. "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3, Cold turkey , 2021-11-09 04:59:34 , reddit post , I’ve been taking bupropion 300mg for 3 months now and about a week ago I forgot to take it for 2 days and didn’t feel any difference so I decided to keep going to see if I would feel any withdrawals or any different in general. ( I know this sounds dumb but I just wanted to see what would happen ) and so far nothing has changed. Have I not been on it long enough to feel any withdrawals? Or could it be that the drug doesn’t affect me much either way because I don’t really remember if it changed anything for me for the past 3 months. 
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2021-11-03 03:09:20 , reddit post , This is so cute ! 
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2021-10-25 00:34:59 , reddit post , Yeah really hope that future doctors will start to look at interactions more in general because there’s no point in taking additional drugs without much of a difference. And yeah a friend of mine used mdma a lot but he was on an ssri so Idek how and why he did that. 
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2021-10-25 00:32:15 , reddit post , Oh damn didn’t know that either thanks! 
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2021-10-25 00:31:45 , reddit post , Yeah that’s why I was wondering since etizolam isn’t a traditional benzo it’s slightly different but same results 
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2021-10-24 20:03:35 , reddit post , Oo yeah that makes sense I’ll try that out soon thanks ! 
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2021-10-24 20:01:35 , reddit post , I see thank you ! 
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2021-10-24 20:00:17 , reddit post , Wow that’s crazy considering quite some people get both of them prescribed for adhd+depression 
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2021-10-24 19:59:04 , reddit post , That’s very interesting so maybe it has something to do with the dosage too or the time when it’s used. Thank you! 
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3, Grapefruit , 2021-10-24 19:51:54 , reddit post , So it’s said that drinking/eating grapefruit makes xanax stay in you system longer hence increasing the effects. Does the same thing happen with etizolam or is it exclusive to alpazolam. 
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2021-10-19 02:33:21 , reddit post , Aw man guess I wasted my money buying it again but thank you for the answer :-))) 
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2021-10-19 01:39:10 , reddit post , Wait this is so weird because bupropion blocks the effects of Ritalin for me but when I wasn’t on bupropion I took Ritalin with speed and it amplified it I was up for 4 days from just one session. 
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2021-10-19 01:31:46 , reddit post , Correct me if I’m wrong this may be stupid but I always thought vyvanse capsules need to be swallowed because they activate through some enzymes (making them less prone to be abused cuz you can’t snort it effectively) So there is a chance that the vyvanse didn’t even “activate” if you snorted it. 
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3, Bupropion increasing tolerance to other stimulants ? , 2021-10-19 01:20:46 , reddit post , I used to be on 10mg Ritalin which worked pretty well for me even though I used it nearly everyday. ( only 2 hours of focus tho). I’ve been off it for around a year now and started taking bupropion 3 months ago. Recently I tried taking the same 10mg Ritalin again and it had no effect on me whatsoever even though i never really built up a tolerance and even had a year break. I don’t know if it’s because bupropion is technically a stimulant which could make it increase ones tolerance or if it’s something else. Has anyone else had a similar experience? 
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2021-10-19 01:13:25 , reddit post ," For me it only made a difference in the first week of switching to 300mg after that my tolerance went back to normal, but I reckon it’s still pretty dangerous so I guess don’t try to drink lots alone and slowly test your limits "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2021-10-19 01:08:53 , reddit post , That’s so weird I’ve been on 300mg for 3 months or something and caffeine barely has an effect on me anymore. I wake up take my meds with coffee and still be able to fall asleep afterwards

eRisk2022-T3_Subject3, Helpless , 2021-04-10 22:02:19 , reddit post ," Hello
I’ve had insomnia for 7 years and I’ve never taken any medications to sleep because I’m scared of getting addicted to them since I’m pretty young. But I can’t seem to get my sleep schedule sorted or actually fall asleep until it’s already way too late. I really don’t know where to go from here. It really just isn’t fun anymore. I’ve treues multiple supplements or melatonin but it doesn’t seem to work at all. I really don’t want to go on stronger medication but I just want to go to sleep like a normal person or at least before 5am for once. I‘m sorry for the rant but I don’t know what to do anymore
Thank you "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject3, anxiety with sobriety , 2021-03-10 12:32:22 , reddit post ," Hi, I've been sober from weed for 2 years now after smoking everyday for 1.5 years. ( not too much i know) I had a lot of anxiety specifically social anxiety before smoking weed and during those 1.5 years i barely had any symptoms which I loved. But after stopping the symptoms came back and it's been getting worse than it was before I started. I really want to feel at ease again but even after trying weed once again about a year ago i can't stand the feeling of being high and the paranoia i get from it now. I even get small seizure like symptoms on weed and no sleep at all even if I'm tired. I honestly thought about going back to weed about a year ago because of the social anxiety but now that i can't even tolerate it anymore i feel kind of hopeless. "

Recently I got back into it but my tolerance is insanely low to the point where I can completely black out after one hit and actually dislike the high. I’ve been trying to get my tolerance up so I can enjoy it like I used to but I keep on getting way too high from barely anything to the point where I can’t speak or function.
Does anyone know why this is happening because my tolerance wasn’t even that low when I first started? "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject3,, 2020-07-04 22:41:48 , reddit post , Even though this situation is very weird. I don’t think she’s mainly upset about the peeing. She is upset that you lied to her. Twice in one moment. Maybe try talking to her about that since it may be connected to her past. Even though it’s very small insignificant lies can be very hurtful in relationships if it builds up.
