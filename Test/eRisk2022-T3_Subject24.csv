and good luck on your test! "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject24,, 2021-05-12 18:51:45 , reddit post ," thank you for the advice! it's in-person unfortunately and I am allowed notes to read off, but I think I'm getting marked on 'engaging with my audience' (yikes) and that I get marked down if I just read off a sheet

It would be great if something happened that meant that it had to be online though "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject24,, 2021-05-12 08:51:00 , reddit post ," as a girl (admittedly not one with any interest in guys) if someone kissed me after two dates I would probably feel a bit weird, I've never kissed anyone in like the first month of seeing them. but i guess it depends on how comfortable you both are. Also even if they were hoping for that, they should still try and be understanding if its not what you also want "

eRisk2022-T3_Subject24, reverse presentation curse , 2021-05-11 21:16:44 , reddit post ," I'm not sure how to really explain this but my whole life I've always somehow got out of doing presentations or speeches, so much that this thing has been given its own name 'the reverse presentation curse'. whether it's that they just don't get round to me or the person I'm presenting to has to leave, I've basically never had to do one. its called the reverse curse because there is nothing worse I can think of than giving a presentation, but its still a curse because one day I will have to do one and it will be my first time ever (and I'll be expected to not freak out because I should have experience). I've been dreading it for the last 6 months and now there's only 1 left until my first one, and there is no way that I can get out of it unless the world ends or I go into a coma. the curse has sort of worked because I'm doing it in front of 2 people instead of the 10 it was meant to be. the only time I've ever had to do something close to a presentation, my voice cracked so much that you couldn't understand what I was saying, and I started crying to the point that the person just took pity and told me I could stop halfway. time to spend the next month just freaking out :') "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject24,, 2021-05-11 21:05:14 , reddit post ," maybe if someone makes a comment about offering to teach you how you could say yes please because you're a bit worried about it. that way people know you're not just being rude, you get to bond with your co-worker over making, and hopefully, you won't be as worried about doing it anymore if you know the exact protocol. unfortunately, I guess that's a bit dependent on someone bringing it up again. (I've never been in an office in my life though so I'm sorry if that's not quite how it works) "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject24,, 2021-05-11 21:00:00 , reddit post ," I can't say that I have much experience as I'm in a similar situation, but if you tell them you feel nervous that might ease the tension a bit especially as you won't have to worry about hiding it if the relationship progresses. also if they have a bad reaction then they maybe aren't someone that is very considerate anyways. as for fear of an intimate moment, you should never have to feel pressure to do something that you don't feel comfortable doing, even if that's just a hug, and whoever you are with should respect that :) "
eRisk2022-T3_Subject24,, 2021-05-11 20:48:47 , reddit post ," I'm a high school student and used to have an English teacher that I think probably felt the same way. she was shy but she was a good teacher so we all respected her and were thankful that she was doing a good job of teaching us, despite how nervous it may have made her. I get that won't make the nerves go away but thank you for teaching despite how hard it is for you, and that until you can feel confident in front of a class you're still doing an applaudable job :)

I feel like everything pandemic-related has just made me able to not have to confront as many social situations/ made them easier, especially masks where I don't have to worry about getting facial expressions right, and if you talk too quiet people just put it down to being the mask. when it all goes back to normal I'm worried everything will be even harder than before :( "
